*Fey Ancestry.* You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

*Trance.* Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
