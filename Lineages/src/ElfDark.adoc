*Fey Ancestry.* You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

*Trance.* Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

*Languages.* You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.

*Military Authority.* You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill

*Dark Magic.* You know the booming blade cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the wrathful smite spell once with this trait; you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the branding smite spell once per day with this trait; you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

*Dark Elf Weapon Training.* You have proficiency with the longsword, warhammer and lance.
