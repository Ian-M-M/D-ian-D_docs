== *Warlock Pacts*

=== The Fiend

You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a
being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such
beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately
including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon
lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils
such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and
balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the
yugoloths.

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn
a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell
list for you.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Dark One's Blessing

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit
points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier +
your warlock level (minimum of 1).

==== 6th LEVEL: Dark One's Own Luck

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your
favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use
this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the
initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.

==== 10th LEVEL: Fiendish Resilience

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a
short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you
choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or
silver weapons ignores this resistance.

==== 14th LEVEL: Hurl Through Hell

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can
use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower
planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare
landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it
previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is
not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific
experience.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.

=== The Great Old One

Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to
the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space
beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in
legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge
so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in
comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be
unaware of your existence or entirely indifferent to you, but the
secrets you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it. Entities
of this type include Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the
Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great
Cthulhu; and other unfathomable beings.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Great Old One Expanded Spell List

The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when
you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock
spell list for you.

*Expanded Spells*

|===

==== 3rd Awakened Mind

Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to
touch the minds of other creatures. You can telepathically speak to any
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a
language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic
utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one
language.

==== 6th LEVEL: Entropic Ward

At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to
turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a
creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to
impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next
attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the
end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.

==== 10th LEVEL: Thought Shield

Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or
other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic
damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that
creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.

==== 14th LEVEL: Create Thrall

At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the
alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an
incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a
remove curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from
it, or you use this feature again.

You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as
the two of you are on the same plane of existence.

=== The Hexblade

You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfellâ€”a
force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of
shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these
weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The
shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form
pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those
formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the
dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.

Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these
weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that
the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to
manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Expanded Spell List

The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you
learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock
spell list for you.

*Hexblade Expanded Spells*

==== 3rd LEVEL: Hexblade's Curse

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on
someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30
feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if
the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse
ends, you gain the following benefits:

* {blank}

____
You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus
equals your proficiency bonus.

Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on
a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
____
* {blank}
+
____
If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock
level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).
____

You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Hex Warrior

At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm
yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields,
and martial weapons.

The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your
will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you
can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the
two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your
Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and
damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you
later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every
pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.

==== 6th LEVEL: Accursed Specter

Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay,
temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you
can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, the
statistics for which are in the Monster Manual. When the specter
appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level.
Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your
verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).

The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long
rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature
again until you finish a long rest.

==== 10th LEVEL: Armor of Hexes

At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by
your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your
reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you,
regardless of its roll.

==== 14th LEVEL: Master of Hexes

Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a
slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your
Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature
you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated.
When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from
the death of the previously cursed creature.
