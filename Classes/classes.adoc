=== *Optional Rule: Firearm Proficiency*

The secrets of creating and operating gunpowder weapons have been
discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. If your Dungeon
Master uses the rules on firearms in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's
Guide and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such
weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.

=== *Magical Tinkering*

At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane
objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's
tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny non magical object as an action and
give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

* {blank}
+
____
The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an
additional 5 feet.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that
can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow
this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6
seconds long.
____
* {blank}
+
____
The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal
sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is
perceivable up to 10 feet away.
____
* {blank}
+
____
A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This
effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a
mixture of these elements, as you like.
____

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the
object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time
you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property
at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this
feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of
one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property
immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

=== *Spellcasting*

==== *Cantrips*

You can prepare two Cantrips, you learn one extra at 10th level and
another at 14th level. Those Cantrips are from the Artificer Spell List.
Additionally you always have the _Arcane Weapon_ cantrip, and doesn’t
count for the amount of cantrips that you know.

==== *Spell Slots*

Your Class table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

==== *Preparing and Casting Spells*

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace any Spell you have
prepared for this Class with another Spell from your Class Spell List.
At higher levels in this Class, you can prepare more Spells. The amount
of spells you can prepare is equal to your Intelligence modifier + half
your Artificer level, rounded down (minimum of 1). Additionally, the
amount of spells for each level is equal to the amount of Spell Slots
that you have for your current level. Additionally, you always have the
*_Detect Magic_* spell and don't count on your spell prepared for this
class and you can cast it as a ritual as an action.

==== *Spellcasting Ability*

Your Spellcasting Ability is Intelligence.

____
*_Spell save DC_* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier

*_Spell attack modifier_* = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier
____

==== *Spellcasting Focus*

Your Spellcasting Focus is any Tools that you have proficiency with.
Additionally, through your Infusions you will be able to use them as
Spellcasting Focus if the Infusion specifies it.

=== *Infuse Item*

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain
magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are
effectively prototypes of permanent items.

==== *Infusions Known*

When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn,
choosing from the "Artificer Infusions" section at the end of the
class's description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when
you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known
column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the
artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

==== *Artificer Infusions*

Artificers have invented numerous magical infusions, extraordinary
processes that rapidly create magic items. To many, artificers seem like
wonderworkers, accomplishing in hours what others need weeks to
complete.

The description of each of the following infusions details the type of
item that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item
requires attunement.

Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such
an infusion until you are at least that level.

Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an
infusion more than once.

==== *Infusing an Item*

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and
imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic
item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified
in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can
attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to
attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for
attunement (see "Attunement" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's
Guide).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the
infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your
Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if
you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.

You can infuse more than one non magical object at the end of a long
rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column
of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of
your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object
can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed
your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends,
and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of
holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

=== *Artificer Specialist*

At 3rd level, you choose the type of specialist you are, each of which
is detailed at the end of the class's description. Your choice grants
you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level.

=== *The Right Tool for the Job*

At 3rd level, you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with
thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one
set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This
creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with
a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are
nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Artificer Specialist Feature*

At 5th level, you gain a feature granted by your Artificer Specialist
choice.

=== *Tool Expertise*

Starting at 6th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability
check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

=== *Flash of Genius*

Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions
under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet
of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your
reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish
a long rest.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Artificer Specialist Feature*

At 9th level, you gain a feature granted by your Artificer Specialist
choice.

=== *Magic Item Adept*

When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how
to use and make magic items:

You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes
you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the
usual gold.

=== *Spell-Storing Item*

At 11th level, you learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you
finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one
item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in
it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list
that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the
spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the
spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell
stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to
twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use
this feature again to store a spell in an object.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Magic Item Savant*

At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more:

You can attune to up to five magic items at once.

You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to
or using a magic item.

=== *Artificer Specialist Feature*

At 15th level, you gain a feature granted by your Artificer Specialist
choice.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Magic Item Master*

Starting at 18th level, you can attune to up to six magic items at once.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Soul of Artifice*

At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items,
which you can draw on for protection:

You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are
currently attuned to.

If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use
your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to
drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

== *Artificer Specialists*
:toclevels: 2

=== *Alchemist*

An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents to produce mystical
effects. Alchemists use their creations to give life and to leech it
away. Alchemy is the oldest of artificer traditions, and its versatility
has long been valued during times of war and peace.

==== *3rd LEVEL: Tool Proficiency*

When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
with alchemist's supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you
gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

==== *3rd LEVEL: Alchemist Spells*

Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you
reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Spells
table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't
count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

==== *Alchemist Spells*

[width="100%",cols="32%,68%",options="header",]
|===
|*Artificer Level* |*Spell*
|3rd |healing word, ray of sickness
|5th |flaming sphere, Melf's acid arrow
|9th |gaseous form, mass healing word
|13th |blight, death ward
|17th |cloudkill, raise dead
|===

==== *3rd LEVEL: Experimental Elixir*

Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can
magically produce an experimental elixir in an empty flask you touch.
Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir's effect, which is
triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can
drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.

Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist's
supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature
lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs
at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level.
Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its own
flask.

You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot
of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action
to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the
elixir's effect from the Experimental Elixir table.

===== *Experimental Elixir*

[width="100%",cols="6%,94%",options="header",]
|===
|*d6* |*Effect*
|1 |*Healing*. The drinker regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 +
your Intelligence modifier.

|2 |*Swiftness*. The drinker's walking speed increases by 10 feet for 1
hour.

|3 |*Resilience*. The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes.

|4 |*Boldness*. The drinker can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to
every attack roll and saving throw they make for the next minute.

|5 |*Flight*. The drinker gains a flying speed of 10 feet for 10
minutes.

|6 |*Transformation*. The drinker's body is transformed as if by the
alter self spell. The drinker determines the transformation caused by
the spell, the effects of which last for 10 minutes.
|===

==== *5th LEVEL: Alchemical Savant*

At 5th level, you develop masterful command of magical chemicals,
enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you
cast a spell using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus,
you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore hit
points or be a damage roll that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison
damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

==== *9th LEVEL: Restorative Reagents*

Starting at 9th level, you can incorporate restorative reagents into
some of your works:

* {blank}
+
____
Whenever a creature drinks an experimental elixir you created, the
creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
____
* {blank}
+
____
You can cast lesser restoration without expending a spell slot and
without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as
the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your
Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended
uses when you finish a long rest.
____

==== *15th LEVEL: Chemical Mastery*

By 15th level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose
little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain
ailments:

* {blank}
+
____
You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are immune
to the poisoned condition.
____
* {blank}
+
____
You can cast greater restoration and heal without expending a spell
slot, without preparing the spell, and without material components,
provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. Once
you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with
it again until you finish a long rest.
____

=== *Artillerist*

An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl energy, projectiles,
and explosions on a battlefield. This destructive power was valued by
all the armies of the Last War. Now that the war is over, some members
of this specialization have sought to build a more peaceful world by
using their powers to fight the resurgence of strife in Khorvaire.

==== *3rd LEVEL: Tool Proficiency*

When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
with woodcarver's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain
proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

==== *3rd LEVEL: Artillerist Spells*

Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you
reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Artillerist
Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they
don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

===== *Artillerist Spells*

[width="100%",cols="35%,65%",options="header",]
|===
|*Artificer Level* |*Spell*
|3rd |shield, thunderwave
|5th |scorching ray, shatter
|9th |fireball, wind wall
|13th |ice storm, wall of fire
|17th |cone of cold, wall of force
|===

==== *3rd LEVEL: Eldritch Cannon*

At 3rd level, you learn how to create a magical cannon. Using
woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can take an action to magically
create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a
horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon
occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand.

Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long
rest or until you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. You can
have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is
present.

The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC
of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer
level. It is immune to poison damage and psychic damage, and all
conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw,
treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on
it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit
points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.

When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it
has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on
the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus
action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it.
As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or
climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.

===== *Eldritch Cannons*

[width="100%",cols="15%,85%",options="header",]
|===
|*Cannon* |*Activation*
|Flamethrower |The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that
you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving
throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any
flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

a|
Force

Ballista

|Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one
creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8
force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet
away from the cannon.

|Protector |The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants
itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of
temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum
of +1).
|===

==== *5th LEVEL: Arcane Firearm*

At 5th level, you know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane
firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. When you finish a long
rest, you can use woodcarver's tools to carve special sigils into a
wand, staff, or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The
sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different
item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely.

You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your
artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm,
roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal
to the number rolled.

==== *9th LEVEL: Explosive Cannon*

Starting at 9th level, every eldritch cannon you create is more
destructive:

* {blank}
+
____
The cannon's damage rolls all increase by 1d8.
____
* {blank}
+
____
As an action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within
60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature
within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell
save DC, taking 3d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one.
____
* {blank}

==== *15th LEVEL: Fortified Position*

Starting at 15th level, you're a master at forming well-defended
emplacements using Eldritch Cannon:

* {blank}
+
____
You and your allies have half cover while within 10 feet of a cannon you
create with Eldritch Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of
magical protection that the cannon emits.
____
* {blank}
+
____
You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with
the same action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both
of them with the same bonus action. You determine whether the cannons
are identical to each other or different. You can't create a third
cannon while you have two.
____

=== *Battle Smith*

Armies require protection, and someone has to put things back together
if defenses fail. A combination of protector and medic, a Battle Smith
is an expert at defending others and repairing both material and
personnel. To aid in their work, Battle Smiths are usually accompanied
by a steel defender, a protective companion of their own creation. Many
soldiers tell stories of nearly dying before being saved by a Battle
Smith and a steel defender.

Battle Smiths played a key role in House Cannith's work on battle
constructs and the original warforged, and after the Last War, these
artificers led efforts to aid those who were injured in the war's
horrific battles.

==== *3rd LEVEL: Tool Proficiency*

When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
with smith's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain
proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

==== *3rd LEVEL: Battle Smith Spells*

Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you
reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Smith
Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they
don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

===== *Battle Smith Spells*

[width="100%",cols="33%,67%",options="header",]
|===
|*Artificer Level* |*Spell*
|3rd |heroism, shield

|17th |banishing smite, mass cure wounds
|===

==== *3rd LEVEL: Battle Ready*

When you reach 3rd level, your combat training and your experiments with
magic have paid off in two ways:

* {blank}
+
____
You gain proficiency with martial weapons.
____
* {blank}
+
____
When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence
modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and
damage rolls.
____

==== *3rd LEVEL: Steel Defender*

By 3rd level, your tinkering has borne you a faithful companion, a steel
defender. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your
commands. See this creature's game statistics in the steel defender stat
block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You
determine the creature's appearance and whether it has two legs or four;
your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

In combat, the defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its
turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its
own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action,
unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take
another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other
action. If you are incapacitated, the defender can take any action of
its choice, not just Dodge.

If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has
died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action
to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a
spell slot of 1st level or higher. The steel defender returns to life
after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel defender if you
have your smith's tools with you. If you already have a steel defender
from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also
perishes if you die.

==== *5th LEVEL: Extra Attack*

Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

==== *9th LEVEL: Arcane Jolt*

At 9th level, you learn new ways to channel arcane energy to harm or
heal. When either you hit a target with a magic weapon attack or your
steel defender hits a target, you can channel magical energy through the
strike to create one of the following effects:

* {blank}
+
____
The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target.
Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points
to it.
____

You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once on a
turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

==== *15th LEVEL: Improved Defender*

At 15th level, your Arcane Jolt and steel defender become more powerful:

* {blank}
+
____
The extra damage and the healing of your Arcane Jolt both increase to
4d6.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Your steel defender gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class.
____
* {blank}
+
____

force damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier.

=== *Rage*

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a
rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing
heavy armor:

You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus
to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.

You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on
them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked
unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile
creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also
end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian
level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. You may
rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.

=== *Unarmored Defense*

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your
Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield
and still gain this benefit.

=== *Danger Sense*

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as
they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You
have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can
see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be
blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

=== *Reckless Attack*

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to
attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your
turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage
on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack
rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

=== *Primal Path*

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage from
the list of available paths. Your choice grants you features at 3rd
level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

=== *Primal Knowledge*

3rd-level barbarian optional feature

When you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, you gain proficiency
in one skill of your choice from the list of skills available to
barbarians at 1st level.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Extra Attack*

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

=== *Fast Movement*

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't
wearing heavy armor.

=== *Path Feature*

At 6th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.

=== *Feral Instinct*

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on
initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't
incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you
enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

=== *Instinctive Pounce*

7th-level barbarian optional feature

As part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage, you can move up
to half your speed.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Brutal Critical (1 die)*

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die
when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee
attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional
dice at 17th level.

=== *Path feature*

At 10th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.

=== *Relentless Rage*

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous
wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die
outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you
succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.
When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Brutal Critical (2 dice)*

At 13th level, you can roll two additional weapon damage dice when
determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to three additional dice at 17th level.

=== *Path feature*

At 14th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.

=== *Persistent Rage*

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only
if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Brutal Critical (3 dice)*

At 17th level, you can roll three additional weapon damage dice when
determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

=== *Indomitable Might*

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than
your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Primal Champion*

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and
Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now
24.

== *Barbarian Paths*

=== Path of the Ancestral Guardian

Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These
tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty
spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who
follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and
calls on these guardian spirits for aid.

Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to
protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their
ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in
elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors' deeds. These tattoos
tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome
rivals.

==== *4TH LEVEL: Ancestral Protectors*

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors
appear when you enter your rage. While you're raging, the first creature
you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors,
which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target
has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the
target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has
resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target
ends early if your rage ends.

==== *6TH LEVEL: Spirit Shield*

Beginning at 6th level, the guardian spirits that aid you can provide
supernatural protection to those you defend. If you are raging and
another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can
use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage
by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.

==== *10TH LEVEL: Consult the Spirits*

At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral
spirits. When you do so, you cast the augury or clairvoyance spell,
without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating
a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of
your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your
spellcasting ability for these spells.

After you cast either spell in this way, you can't use this feature
again until you finish a short or long rest.

==== *14TH LEVEL: Vengeful Ancestors*

At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate.
When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the
attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your
Spirit Shield prevents.

=== Path of the Berserker

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence.
The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury. As you enter
the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle.

==== *3RD LEVEL: Frenzy*

You can go into a frenzy in battle. If you use Reckless Attack while
your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit
on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra
damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add
them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or Unarmed
Strike used for the attack.

==== *6TH LEVEL: Mindless Rage*

You have immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions while your
Rage is active. If you are Charmed or Frightened when you enter your
Rage, that condition ends on you.

==== *10TH LEVEL: Retaliation*

When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you
can use your Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature,
using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

==== *14TH LEVEL: Intimidating Presence*

Instead of one of your attacks, you can strike terror into others with
your menacing presence, as you swell with primal power. When you do so,
each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you—or 60 feet of you if
your Rage is active—must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 +
your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier), provided the creature
isn’t behind Total Cover. On a failed save, a creature has the
Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened
creature’s turns, the creature repeats the saving throw, ending the
effect on itself on a successful save.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
Long Rest. If you’ve run out of

uses of this feature, you can expend a use of your Rage, choosing not to
activate the Rage and

activating Intimidating Presence instead.

=== Path of the Totem Warrior

The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian
accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle,
your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel
to your barbarian rage.

Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular
clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than
one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.

==== *3RD LEVEL: Spirit Seeker*

Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you
a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain
the ability to cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but
only as rituals, as described in chapter 10.

==== *3RD LEVEL: Totem Spirit*

At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and
gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object—an
amulet or similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws,
teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor
physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For
example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy
and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright
yellow.

Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but
more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk
or vulture in place of an eagle.

*_Bear._*

While raging, at the start of your turn you gain temporary hit points to
equal your Constitution mod + your barbarian level. The spirit of the
bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

*_Eagle._*

While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have
disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use
the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle
makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.

*_Elk._*

While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed
increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily
swift.

*_Tiger._*

While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet
to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.

*_Wolf._*

While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls
against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The
spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.

==== *6TH LEVEL: Aspect of the Beast*

At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of
your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or
a different one.

*_Bear._*

You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum
load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength
checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.

*_Eagle._*

You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no
difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at
something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light
doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.

*_Elk._*

Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the
travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you
and you're not incapacitated. The elk spirit helps you roam far and
fast.

*_Tiger._*

You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: Athletics,
Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. The cat spirit hones your survival
instincts.

*_Wolf._*

You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other
creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily
while traveling at a normal pace.

==== *10TH LEVEL: Spirit Walker*

At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature spell, but only as a
ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you
chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey
the information you seek.

==== *14TH LEVEL: Totemic Attunement*

At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of
your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a
different one.

*_Bear._*

While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to
you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or
another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect
if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.

*_Eagle._*

While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking
speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your
turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

*_Elk._*

While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass
through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must
succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength bonus + your
proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone and take bludgeoning damage equal
to 1d12 + your Strength modifier.

*_Tiger._*

While you're raging, if you move at least 20 feet in a straight line
toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon
attack against it, you can use a bonus action to make an additional
melee weapon attack against it.

*_Wolf._*

While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a
Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with a melee weapon
attack.

take 1d6 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it
makes before the end of its next turn.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6),
11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

You learn cantrips from the Spell List associated for your Class as the
table of your class stays. Additionally, you learn _Vicious Mockery_
that doesn’t count to your Cantrips Knows.

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score
Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this
class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the bard spell
list.

==== *Spell Slots*

Your Class table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

==== *Preparing and Casting Spells*

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace any Spell you have
prepared for this Class with another Spell from your Class Spell List.
At higher levels in this Class, you can prepare more Spells. The amount
of spells you can prepare is equal to your Charisma modifier + your bard
level (minimum of 1).

The amount of spells that you are able to prepare for each level is
determined by the amount of spell slots that you have for each level.

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help
revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any
friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points by
spending Hit Dice at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures
regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this
class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th
level.

Additionally, you have learned how to use music, poetry, and dance to
heal wounds and maladies. When you reach certain levels in this Class,
you add a specific Spell to your Songs of Restoration repertoire, as
shown on the Songs of Restoration Repertoire table. You always have that
Spell prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of Spells you
can prepare.

Inspiration isn’t expended.

Inspiration you don’t spend your reaction. Additionally, if you use it
to *_Boosts a d20 Roll_*, and it fails, you don’t spend that use.

== *Bard Colleges*

=== College of Lore

Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things,
collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes
and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate
compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold
audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members
might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from
their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to
the king.

The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not
in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who
keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would
rather be honest than politic.

The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual
colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore
with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where
they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important
figures of authority.

==== *3RD LEVEL: Bonus Proficiencies*

When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
with three skills of your choice.

==== *3RD LEVEL: Cutting Words*

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse,
and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an
ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one
of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and
subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose
to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM
determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails,
or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it
can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

==== *6TH LEVEL: Additional Magical Secret*

At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A
spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but
don't count against the number of bard spells you know.

==== *14TH LEVEL: Peerless Skill*

Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend
one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the
number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you
roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether
you succeed or fail.

=== College of Glamour

The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in
the vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone who
dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards
learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.

The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear.
Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent
that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to
release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into
complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also
bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community
for weeks, misusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic
bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden
and undermine oppressors.

==== *3RD LEVEL: Mantle of Inspiration*

When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability
to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and
speed.

As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to
grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a number of
creatures you can see and that can see you within 60 feet of you, up to
a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of them
gains 5 temporary hit points. When a creature gains these temporary hit
points, it can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed,
without provoking opportunity attacks.

The number of temporary hit points increases when you reach certain
levels in this class, increasing to 8 at 5th level, 11 at 10th level,
and 14 at 15th level.

==== *3RD LEVEL: Enthralling Performance*

Starting at 3rd level, you can charge your performance with seductive,
fey magic.

If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to inspire wonder
in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the end of
the performance, choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who
watched and listened to all of it, up to a number equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in
this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone
who talks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it
avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf.
This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if
you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its
allies.

If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that
you tried to charm it.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.

==== *6TH LEVEL: Mantle of Majesty*

At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that
makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast command,
without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of
unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if
you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast
command as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending a
spell slot.

Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against
the command you cast with this feature.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.

==== *14TH LEVEL: Unbreakable Majesty*

At 14th level, your appearance permanently gains an otherworldly aspect
that makes you look more lovely and fierce.

In addition, as a bonus action, you can assume a magically majestic
presence for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration,
whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn,
the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save
DC. On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must
choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a
successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage
on any saving throw it makes against your spells on your next turn.

Once you assume this majestic presence, you can't do so again until you
finish a short or long rest.

=== *Spellcasting*

==== *Cantrips*

You learn cantrips from the druid spell List Cantrips Knows on the
Cleric table shows. Additionally, you learn the _Sacred Flame_, it
doesn’t count to your Cantrips Knows.

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the __Ability Score
Improvemen__t feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this
class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the druid class
spell list.

==== *Spell Slots*

Your Class table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

==== *Preparing and Casting Spells*

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace any Spell you have
prepared for this Class with another Spell from the Cleric Class Spell
List. At higher levels in this Class, you can prepare more Spells. The
amount of spells you can prepare is equal to your Wisdom modifier + your
Cleric level. The amount of spells that you are able to prepare for each
level is determined by the amount of spell slots that you have for each
level.

==== *Spellcasting Ability*

Your spellcasting ability is Wisdom:

____
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
____

==== *Spellcasting Focus*

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric
spells.

==== *Ritual Casting*

You can cast any spell from your Prepared Spells of this class as a
ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

=== *Divine Domain*

Choose one domain related to your deity from the list of available
domains. Each domain is detailed in their own feature, and each one
provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you
domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It
also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain
that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th
levels.

==== Domain Spells

Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the
cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain
spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the
number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list,
the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

=== *Channel Divinity*

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly
from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start
with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your
domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in
levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create.
You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such
an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between
rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between
rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended
uses.

==== *Channel Divinity: Turn Undead*

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring
the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw,
it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of
you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
action.

==== *Channel Divinity: Harness Divine Power*

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a
bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one
expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your
proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this
feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 2nd level,
once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended
uses when you finish a long rest.

=== *Divine Domain feature*

At 2nd level, you gain a feature from your Divine Domain.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly
destroyed.

throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly
destroyed.

=== *Divine Domain feature*

At 8th level, you gain a feature from your Divine Domain.

=== *Divine Intervention*

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your
behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the
assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number
equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM
chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell
or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes,
you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it
again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no
roll required.

The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well
as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such
as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death
knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain
also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or
Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the
underworld (Hades and Hel).

At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells
prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

*Death Domain Spells*

[width="100%",cols="17%,83%",options="header",]
|===
|*Cleric Level* |*Spells*
|1st |false life, ray of sickness
|3rd |blindness/deafness, ray of enfeeblement
|5th |animate dead, vampiric touch
|7th |blight, death ward
|9th |antilife shell, cloudkill
|===

==== 1st LEVEL: Bonus Proficiency

When the cleric chooses this domain at 1st level, he or she gains
proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.

==== 1st LEVEL: Reaper

At 1st level, you learn one necromancy cantrip of your choice from any
spell list. When you cast a necromancy cantrip or spell of level 1 or
higher, that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead
target two creatures within range.

==== 2nd LEVEL: Channel Divinity: Touch of Death

Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to destroy another
creature's life force by touch.

When the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, the cleric can use
Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage
equals 5 + twice your cleric level.

==== 6th LEVEL: Inescapable Destruction

Starting at 6th level, the cleric's ability to channel negative energy
becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by your cleric spells and
Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

==== 8th LEVEL: Blessed Strikes

Starting at 8th level, you are blessed with divine might in battle. When
a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you
can also deal 1d8 necrotic damage to that creature. Once you deal this
damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next
turn.

==== 17th LEVEL: Improved Reaper

Starting at 17th level, when you cast a Necromancy spell that targets
only one creature, the spell deals max damage. Once you use this trait
you can’t use it until you finish a long rest.

=== Life Domain

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the
fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of
life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded,
caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and
undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain,
particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and
Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of
healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht),
and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells
prepared.

*Life Domain Spells*

[width="100%",cols="16%,84%",options="header",]
|===
|*Cleric Level* |*Spells*
|*1st* |*bless, cure wounds*
|*3rd* |*lesser restoration, spiritual weapon*
|*5th* |*beacon of hope, revivify*
|*7th* |*death ward, guardian of faith*
|*9th* |*mass cure wounds, raise dead*
|===

==== 1st LEVEL: Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with
heavy armor.

==== 1st LEVEL: Disciple of Life

Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective.
Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to
a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the
spell's level.

==== 2nd LEVEL: Channel Divinity: Preserve Life

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the
badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that
can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric
level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit
points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than
half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead
or a construct.

==== 6th LEVEL: Blessed Healer

Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you
as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit
points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 +
the spell's level.

==== 8th LEVEL: Blessed Strikes

You are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes
damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal
1d8 radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you
can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

==== 17th LEVEL: Supreme Healing

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to
restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number
possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points
to a creature, you restore 12.

=== Peace Domain

The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between
friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace
inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against
those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing. See the Peace
Deities table for a list of some of the gods associated with this
domain.

Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and
they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics' blessings
draw people together and help them shoulder one another's burdens, and
the clerics' magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of
peace.

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Peace Domain
Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells
work.

*Peace Domain Spells*

[width="100%",cols="10%,90%",options="header",]
|===
|*Cleric Level* |*Spells*
|1st |heroism, sanctuary
|3rd |aid, warding bond
|5th |beacon of hope, sending
|7th |aura of purity, Otiluke's resilient sphere
|9th |greater restoration, Rary's telepathic bond
|===

==== 1st LEVEL: Implement of Peace

You gain proficiency in the Insight, Performance, or Persuasion skill
(your choice).

==== 1st LEVEL: Emboldening Bond

You can forge an empowering bond among people who are at peace with one
another. As an action, you choose a number of willing creatures within
30 feet of you (this can include yourself) equal to your proficiency
bonus. You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you
use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of
another, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an
attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature
can add the d4 no more than once per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

==== 2nd LEVEL: Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace

You can use your Channel Divinity to make your very presence a soothing
balm. As an action, you can move up to your speed, without provoking
opportunity attacks, and when you move within 5 feet of any other
creature during this action, you can restore a number of hit points to
that creature equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 hit
point). A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take
this action.

==== 6th LEVEL: Protective Bond

The bond you forge between people helps them protect each other. When a
creature affected by your Emboldening Bond feature is about to take
damage, a second bonded creature within 30 feet of the first can use its
reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the first
creature. The second creature then takes all the damage instead.

==== 8th LEVEL: Blessed Strikes

You are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes
damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal
1d8 radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you
can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

==== 17th LEVEL: Expansive Bond

The benefits of your Emboldening Bond and Protective Bond features now
work when the creatures are within 60 feet of each other. Moreover, when
a creature uses Protective Bond to take someone else's damage, the
creature has resistance to that damage.

|===

=== Animalistic Invocations

At 1st level, you learn the specific form as a creature gaining the
ability given by that beast. You can choose 1 animalistic Invocation
with which you have access to the form that it requires, additionally
you can use this trait when you have in other forms (like using the
poison of a snake while you are in aquatic form).

You gain the benefits of the given trait as long as you are in your
Wildshape.

You learn additional Animalistic Invocations as shown in the Animalistic
Invocations column. When you learn new Invocations you can replace one
of the Invocations that you know.

===

=== Channel Nature

At 1st level, the magic of nature infuses you. Tapping into that power,
you can create various magical

effects. You start with one such effect: Wild Shape, which is described
below. Other Druid features give additional Channel Nature effect
options. Each time you use this Channel Nature, you choose which effect
to create from among those you have from this class. You can use Channel
Nature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest,
and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

You gain additional uses at 5th and 9th level. At 20th level you get
unlimited uses.

If a Channel Nature effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the
Spell Save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

*Wild Shape*. As an action, you transform into a form that you have
learned for this feature. You start knowing one form, Animal of the
Land, which is detailed in the “Wild Shapes” section later in this
class’s description. You stay in that form for a number of hours equal
to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the
Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also end Wild Shape early as a
Bonus Action. While in a form, its game statistics replace yours, and
your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs, rather
than your own. You retain your personality, memories, ability to speak,
Wild Shape, skills and saving throw proficiencies. You lose access to
all your other features, such as the ability to cast spells (you can
continue to concentrate on one). When you transform, you choose whether
your equipment falls to the ground in your space or merges into your new
form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave
the form.

=== Druidic

At 1st level, you know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can
speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others
who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot
the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check
but can't decipher it without magic.

=== *Spellcasting*

==== *Cantrips*

You learn cantrips from the druid spell List Cantrips Knows on the Druid
table shows. Additionally, you learn the Druidcraft Cantrip it doesn’t
count to your Cantrips Knows.

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the __Ability Score
Improvemen__t feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this
class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the druid class
spell list.

==== *Spell Slots*

Your Class table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

==== *Preparing and Casting Spells*

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace any Spell you have
prepared for this Class with another Spell from the Druid Class Spell
List. At higher levels in this Class, you can prepare more Spells. The
amount of spells you can prepare is equal to your Wisdom modifier + your
Druid level (minimum of 1). The amount of spells that you are able to
prepare for each level is determined by the amount of spell slots that
you have for each level.

==== *Spellcasting Ability*

Your spellcasting ability is Wisdom:

____
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
____

==== *Spellcasting Focus*

You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid
spells.

==== *Ritual Casting*

You can cast any spell from your Prepared Spells of this class as a
ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

=== *Nature’s Aid*

At 2nd level, you learn two more ways to use your Channel Nature—Healing
Blossoms and Wild Companion—each of which is described below.

*Healing Blossoms.* As an action, you channel healing energy that
appears as blooming flowers. Choose a point within 30 feet of yourself,
and spectral flowers appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius sphere
centered on that point. Then roll a number of d4s equal to your Wisdom
modifier (minimum of one die), and add the dice together. The total is
the number of Hit Points you can distribute to creatures in that sphere.
You decide the number of Hit Points that are restored to each of those
creatures, deducting the healing from the total.

*Wild Companion.* You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal
form to aid you. As an action, you can expend a use of your Channel
Nature and cast the Find Familiar spell without material components.
When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a Fey, and it
disappears when you finish a Long Rest.

=== *Druid Circle*

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the
list of available circles. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level
and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

=== Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Might of the Land*

At 5th level, your connection to the land deepens, empowering the Animal
of the Land form of your *Wild Shape*; you unlock that form’s Climb
Speed and Multiattack.

=== *Druid Circle*

At 6th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle feature.

=== *Aquatic Form*

At 7th level, you learn a new form for your *Wild Shape:* Animal of the
Sea, which is described in the “Wild Shapes” section later in this
class’s description.

=== Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Aerial Form*

At 9th level, you learn a new form for your *Wild Shape:* Animal of the
Sky, which is described in the “Wild Shapes” section later in this
class’s description.

=== *Druid Circle*

At 10th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle feature.

=== *Tiny Critter*

At 11th level, you gain the ability to become a Tiny creature. When you
transform into a *Wild Shape* form, you can make it Tiny. If you do so,
you can stay in that form no longer than 10 minutes, and the damage you
deal in that form is halved.

=== Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 12h level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Alternating Forms*

At 13th level, you can now rapidly shift between a *Wild Shape* form and
your normal form. If you’re in a Wild Shape form, you can switch to your
normal form as a Bonus Action, and you can then switch back into that
Wild Shape form within the next minute as a Bonus Action. Neither switch
expends a use of Wild Shape.

=== *Druid Circle*

At 14th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle feature.

=== *Wild Resurge*

At 15th level, when you use your Wild Shape, primal magic radiates from
you, allowing you to use Healing Blossoms as part of the same use of
Channel Nature.

=== Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Timeless Body*

Starting at 17th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to
age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1
year.

=== *Beast Spells*

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any
shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and
verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you
aren't able to provide material components.

=== Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Archdruid*

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your
druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and
aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal
shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

====  +

=== *WILD SHAPES FORM*

When you use your Wild Shape, you transform into a form you’ve learned
for this feature. This section includes three forms: Animal of the Land,
Animal of the Sea, and Animal of the Sky.

As you assume a form, you determine its appearance, selecting an example
animal from the form’s description, selecting another appropriate
animal, or choosing a hybrid form that incorporates visual
characteristics from two or more animals. The appearance you choose has
no effect on the form’s capabilities.

When choosing an animal’s appearance for a form, that animal needn’t be
the same size as the form. For example, you could choose an elephant for
the appearance and Small for the size— creating a form that resembles a
little elephant.

An Animal of the Land is a flightless terrestrial animal, such as a
bear, deer, horse, cat, dog, velociraptor, or big rodent. While in this

== *Druid Circles*

=== Circle of the Land

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard
ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids
meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal
secrets in Druidic.

The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities
that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those
folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land
where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.

==== 2nd LEVEL: Bonus Cantrip

You learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip
doesn't count against the number of druid cantrips you know.

==== 2nd LEVEL: Natural Recovery

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by
sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest,
you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level
(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You
can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two
levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or
two 1st-level slots.

==== 2nd LEVEL: Circle Spells

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to
cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to
circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose
that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or
Underdark—and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and
it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell
list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

==== 6th LEVEL: Land's Stride

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs
you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those
created by the entangle spell.

==== 10th LEVEL: Nature's Ward

When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by
elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

==== 14th LEVEL: Nature's Sanctuary

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your
connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or
plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a
successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against
you.

=== Circle of the Moon

Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds.
Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade
warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they
might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid
creature, let alone another druid.

Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great
cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and
crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing
monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.

==== 2nd LEVEL: Combat Wild Shape

You gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action,
rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a
bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level
of the spell slot expended.

==== 2nd LEVEL: Circle Forms

The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more
dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, when you gain a trait
given by this subclass, you can learn one additional Animalistic
Invocation that you are capable of.

==== 6th LEVEL: Primal Strike

Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for
the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non magical attacks
and damage.

==== 10th LEVEL: Elemental Wild Shape

At 10th level, you learn how to infuse your Wildshape with elemental
magic, you learn the following Animalistic Invocations, you can use only
one of them when you transform.

* {blank}

action to douse the fire, the target takes 5 (1d12) fire damage at the
start of each of its turns.

____

==== 14th LEVEL: Thousand Forms

By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical form
in more subtle ways. You can cast the alter self spell at will.

=== Circle of Stars

The Circle of Stars allows druids to draw on the power of starlight.
These druids have tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial,
discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By revealing and
understanding these secrets, the Circle of the Stars seeks to harness
the powers of the cosmos.

Many druids of this circle keep records of the constellations and the
stars' effects on the world. Some groups document these observations at
megalithic sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore. These
repositories might take the form of stone circles, pyramids,
petroglyphs, and underground temples-any construction durable enough to
protect the circle's sacred knowledge even against a great cataclysm.

==== 2nd LEVEL: Star Map

You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a
Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing
one.

*Star Map*

[width="100%",cols="6%,94%",options="header",]
|===
|*d6* |*Map Form*
|1 |A scroll covered with depictions of constellations
|2 |A stone tablet with fine holes drilled through it
|3 |A speckled owlbear hide, tooled with raised marks
|4 |A collection of maps bound in an ebony cover
|5 |A crystal that projects starry patterns when placed before a light
|6 |Glass disks that depict constellations
|===

While holding this map, you have these benefits:

* {blank}
+
____
You know the
https://5e.tools/spells.html#guidance_phb[[.underline]#guidance#]
cantrip.
____
* {blank}
+
____
You have the
https://5e.tools/spells.html#guiding%20bolt_phb[[.underline]#guiding
bolt#] spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it
doesn't count against the number of spells you can have prepared.
____

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically
create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or
long rest, and it destroys the previous map.

==== 2nd LEVEL: Starry Form

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to
take on a starry form, rather than transforming into a beast.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your
body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines
connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a
10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts
for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required),
are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following
constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain
benefits while in the form:

*_Archer._*

A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this
form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you
can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets
one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant
damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

*_Chalice._*

A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you
cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature,
you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points
equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

*_Dragon._*

A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an
Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to
maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on
the d20 as a 10.

==== 6th LEVEL: Cosmic Omen

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult your Star Map for
omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next long rest,
you gain access to a special reaction based on whether you rolled an
even or an odd number on the die:

* {blank}
+
____
*Weal (even).* Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is
about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you
can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the
total.
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Woe (odd).* Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is
about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you
can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from
the total.
____

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

==== 10th LEVEL: Twinkling Constellations

The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer
and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a
flying speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form,
you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

==== 14th LEVEL: Full of Stars

While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you
resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain
this benefit.

==== *Interception*

When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet

damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to
use this reaction.

of weapon, you decide which of the two properties applies to that
attack. You make this decision before the attack hits or misses.

== *Fighter Archetype*

=== Arcane Shooter

An Arcane Shooter studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves
magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Shooters are
some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over
the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and
using magic-infused shots to defeat monsters and invaders before they
can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these
elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also
balance arcane aptitude with archery.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Arcane Archer Lore

At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of
nature—typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You
gain proficiency in Arcana, and you choose to learn either the
prestidigitation or the druidcraft cantrip.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Arcane Shot

At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of
your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot
options of your choice (see "Arcane Shot Options").

Once per turn when you do a ranged weapon attack as part of the Attack
action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that attack.
You decide to use the option when the attack hits a creature, unless the
option doesn't involve an attack roll. You can use this ability a number
of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended
uses of it when you finish a long rest.

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach
certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each
option also improves when you become a 15th-level fighter.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Arcane Shot Options

The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain
levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are
all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools
of magic.

If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC is
calculated as follows:

*Arcane Shot save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
(if you choose prestidigitation as your cantrip) or Wisdom (if you
choose druidcraft as your cantrip) modifier

==== 7th LEVEL: Magic _Shot_

At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse shots with magic. Whenever
you do a nonmagical attack from a ranged attack weapon, you can make it
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the shot immediately
after it hits or misses its target.

==== 7th LEVEL: Curving Shot

At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new
target. When you make an attack roll with a magic shot and miss, you can
use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target
within 60 feet of the original target.

==== 7th LEVEL: Additional Arcane Shot Option

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach
7th level.

==== 10th LEVEL: Additional Arcane Shot Option

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach
10th level.

==== 15th LEVEL: Ever-Ready Shot

Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever
battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot
remaining, you regain one use of it.

==== 15th LEVEL: Additional Arcane Shot Option

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach
15th level.Each option also improves when you become an 15th-level
fighter.

==== 18th LEVEL: Additional Arcane Shot Option

You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach
18th level.

=== Champion

The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power
honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype
combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating
blows.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Improved Critical

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon
attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

==== 7th LEVEL: Remarkable Athlete

Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round
up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that
doesn't already use your proficiency bonus.

In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can
cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.

==== 10th LEVEL: Additional Fighting Style

At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style
class feature.

==== 15th LEVEL: Superior Critical

Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a
roll of 18-20.

==== 18th LEVEL: Survivor

At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the
start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your
Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points
left. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

=== Eldritch Knight

The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to
all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical
techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study
on two of the eight schools of magic—abjuration and evocation.
Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in
battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending
the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small
number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a
spellbook.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Spellcasting

When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the
ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.

*_Cantrips._*

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You
learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

*_Spell Slots._*

The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You
regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level
and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either
slot.

*_Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher._*

You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you
must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell
list.

The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows
when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these
spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must
be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you
reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd
level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any
school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the
wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard
spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're
replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any
school of magic.

*_Spellcasting Ability._*

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since
you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
one.

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier

==== 3rd LEVEL: Weapon Bond

At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between
yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1
hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within
your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch
the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that
weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of
existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn,
causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

While you have your bonded weapon wield, you can use the action given by
your Action Surge to do the Spellcasting action.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time
with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you
must break the bond with one of the other two.

==== 7th LEVEL: War Magic

Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you
can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

==== 10th LEVEL: Eldritch Strike

At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a
creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw
it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.

==== 15th LEVEL: Arcane Charge

At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an
unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can
teleport before or after the additional action.

==== 18th LEVEL: Improved War Magic

Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you
can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

=== Psi Warrior

Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior is a fighter who
augments their physical might with psi-infused weapon strikes,
telekinetic lashes, and barriers of mental force. Many githyanki train
to become such warriors, as do some of the most disciplined high elves.
In the world of Eberron, many young kalashtar dream of becoming Psi
Warriors.

As a Psi Warrior, you might have honed your psionic abilities through
solo discipline, unlocked it under the tutelage of a master, or refined
it at an academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as both weapon
and shield.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Psionic Power

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy
is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are each a d6. You
have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and
they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.

Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified
in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you
to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your
expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition,
as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but
you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic
Energy dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th
level (d12).

The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.

* {blank}
+
____
*Protective Field.* When you or another creature you can see within 30
feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend one
Psionic Energy die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken by the
number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1),
as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Psionic Strike.* You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once
on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet
of you with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can
expend one Psionic Energy die, rolling it and dealing force damage to
the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Telekinetic Movement.* You can move an object or a creature with your
mind. As an action, you target one loose object that is Large or smaller
or one willing creature, other than yourself. If you can see the target
and it is within 30 feet of you, you can move it up to 30 feet to an
unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you
can move it to or from your hand. Either way, you can move the target
horizontally, vertically, or both. Once you take this action, you can't
do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a
Psionic Energy die to take it again.
____

==== 7th LEVEL: Telekinetic Adept

You have mastered new ways to use your telekinetic abilities, detailed
below.

* {blank}
+
____
*Psi-Powered Leap.* As a bonus action, you can propel your body with
your mind. You gain a flying speed equal to twice your walking speed
until the end of the current turn. Once you take this bonus action, you
can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you
expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Telekinetic Thrust.* When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic
Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against
a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
If the save fails, you can knock the target
https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#prone_phb[[.underline]#prone#]
or move it up to 10 feet in any direction horizontally.
____

==== 10th LEVEL: Guarded Mind

The psionic energy flowing through you has bolstered your mind. You have
resistance to psychic damage. Moreover, if you start your turn charmed
or frightened, you can expend a Psionic Energy die and end every effect
on yourself subjecting you to those conditions.

==== 15th LEVEL: Bulwark of Force

You can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a bonus
action, you can choose creatures, which can include you, that you can
see within 30 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your
Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen
creatures is protected by half cover for 1 minute or until you're
incapacitated.

Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish
a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.

==== 18th LEVEL: Telekinetic Master

Your ability to move creatures and objects with your mind is matched by
few. You can cast the telekinesis spell, requiring no components, and
your spellcasting ability for the spell is Intelligence. On each of your
turns while you concentrate on the spell, including the turn when you
cast it, you can make one attack with a weapon as a bonus action.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so again until
you finish a long rest, unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to cast
it again.

=== Samurai

The Samurai is a fighter who draws on an implacable fighting spirit to
overcome enemies. A Samurai's resolve is nearly unbreakable, and the
enemies in a Samurai's path have two choices: yield or die fighting.

==== 3rd Level: Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one
of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance,
or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.

==== 3rd Level: Fighting Spirit

Starting at 3rd level, your intensity in battle can shield you and help
you strike true. As a bonus action on your turn, you can give yourself
advantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of the current turn. When
you do so, you also gain 5 temporary hit points. The number of temporary
hit points increases when you reach certain levels in this class,
increasing to 10 at 10th level and 15 at 15th level.

You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses
of it when you finish a long rest.

==== 7th Level: Elegant Courtier

Starting at 7th level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you
to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion)
check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving
throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain
proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

==== 10th Level: Tireless Spirit

Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of
Fighting Spirit remaining, you regain one use.

==== 15th Level: Rapid Strike

Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes.
If you take the Attack action on your turn and have advantage on an
attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for
that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as
part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.

==== 18th Level: Strength before Death

Starting at 18th level, your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of
death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn't
kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling
unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn, interrupting
the current turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn,
taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three
death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn
ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.

=== *Unarmored Defense*

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding
a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom
modifier.

=== *Martial Arts*

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that
use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any
simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only
monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield.

* {blank}
+
____
You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage
rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
____
* {blank}
+
____
You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike
or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in
the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
____
* {blank}
+
____
When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon
on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For
example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff,
you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you
haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.
____

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For
example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a
short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter
blade (called a kama).

=== *Ki*

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic
energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of
ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as
shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start
knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step
of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this
class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or
long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back
into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating
to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to
resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as
follows:

____
*_Ki save DC_* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
____

*_Flurry of Blows._*

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend
1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

*_Patient Defense._*

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on
your turn.

*_Step of the Wind._*

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus
action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

=== *Dedicated Weapon*

You train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just
simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or
long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count
that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:

* {blank}

=== *Unarmored Movement*

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not
wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach
certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and
across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

=== *Deflect Missiles*

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the
missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the
damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small
enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.
If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a
ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of ammunition
you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with
proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile
counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

=== *Monastic Tradition*

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition,
chosen from the list of available traditions. Your tradition grants you
features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

=== *Ki-Fueled Attack*

If you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you
can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus
action before the end of the turn.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Slow Fall*

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to
reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your
monk level.

=== *Quickened Healing*

As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and roll a Martial Arts die. You
regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your
proficiency bonus.

=== *Extra Attack*

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

=== *Stunning Strike*

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an
opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon
attack, you can spend 2 ki points to attempt a stunning strike. The
target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until
the end of your next turn. These attacks must be from your Attack
action.

=== *Focused Aim*

When you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to
increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend,
potentially turning the miss into a hit.

=== *Ki-Empowered Strikes*

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non magical attacks and

== *Monk Ways*

=== Way of the Astral Self

A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self believes their body is an
illusion. They see their ki as a representation of their true form, an
astral self. This astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or
disorder, with some monasteries training students to use their power to
protect the weak and other instructing aspirants in how to manifest
their true selves in service to the mighty.

*Forms of Your Astral Self*

The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the monk's soul. As a
result, an astral self can reflect aspects of a monk's background,
ideals, flaws, and bonds, and an astral self doesn't necessarily look
anything like the monk. For example, the astral self of a lanky human
might be reminiscent of a minotaur-the strength of which the monk feels
within. Similarly, an orc monk might manifest gossamer arms and a
delicate visage, representing the gentle beauty of the orc's soul. Each
astral self is unique, and some of the monks of this monastic tradition
are known more for the appearance of their astral self than for their
physical appearance.

When choosing this path, consider the quirks that define your monk. Are
you obsessed with something? Are you driven by justice or a selfish
desire? Any of these motivations could manifest in the form of your
astral self.

==== *3RD LEVEL: Arms of the Astral Self*

Your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral
self. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to summon the arms of
your astral self. When you do so, each creature of your choice that you
can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
or take force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

For 10 minutes, these spectral arms hover near your shoulders or
surround your arms (your choice). You determine the arms' appearance,
and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die.

Astral Self, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your

elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces
of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an
extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate

to bring aid to those in need. They are wandering physicians to the poor
and hurt. However, to those beyond their help, they bring a swift end as
an act of mercy.

Those who follow the Way of Mercy might be members of a religious order,
administering to the needy and making grim choices rooted in reality
rather than idealism. Some might be gentle-voiced healers, beloved by
their communities, while others might be masked bringers of macabre
mercies.

undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know

deeds, and find the path to becoming something great.

interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach
certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as shown in
the Nature Magic Spells table. These spells don't count against the

Nature Magic Spells

[width="100%",cols="18%,82%",options="header",]
|===
|*Ranger Level* |*Spell*
|3rd |Speak with animals
|5th |Beast sense
|9th |Speak with plants
|13th |Locate creature
|17th |Commune with nature
|===

You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot.
Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you
finish a long rest.

=== Spellcasting

By the time you reach 3rd level, you have learned to use the magical
essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10
for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger
spell list.

==== *Cantrips*

You can prepare two Cantrips (you learn one extra at 10th level) ; those
cantrips must be from the Druid spell list.

==== *Spell Slots*

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have
a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal
friendship using either slot.

==== *Preparing and Casting Spells*

Any Spell you prepare for this Class must be a Druid or Ranger Spell.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can commune with nature and replace
any Spell you have prepared for this Class with another Druid or Ranger
Spell. At higher levels in this Class, you can prepare more Spells. The
amount of spells you can prepare is equal to your Wisdom modifier + half
of your Ranger level, rounded down (minimum of 1). Additionally, you
always have the Hunter’s Mark spell prepared and it doesn’t count
against your spells prepared.

==== *Spellcasting Ability*

Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Ranger Spells.

____

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
____

==== *Spellcasting Focus*

You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the Spells you
prepare for this Class.

=== *Ranger* Conclave

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate from
the list of available archetypes. Your choice grants features at 3rd
level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

==== *Channel Nature*

Your ranger archetype allows you to channel nature's energy to fuel
magical effects. Each Channel Nature option provided by your Conclave
explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Nature, you choose which option to use. You
must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Nature again.

Some Channel Nature effects require saving throws. When you use such an
effect from this class, the DC equals your ranger spell save DC.

===== Channel Nature: Invoke Spirit

When you gain your Conclave, you have forged a special bond with a
spirit, that give you your Ranger Conclave traits.

You can expend a use of your Channel Nature to invoice your spirit. You
magically summon a creature which is related to your Conclave. The
spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands.
Choose its stat block—Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of
the Sky—which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You
also determine the form of the spirit, choosing a kind appropriate for
the stat block. Whatever kind you choose, the spirit bears primal
markings, indicating its mystical origin.

In combat, the spirit acts during your turn. It can move and use its
reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action,
unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take
another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other
action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the
Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are
incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just
Dodge.

If the spirit has died within the last hour, you can use your action to
touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The spirit
returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

When you finish a long rest, you can summon the spirit without using
your Channel Nature. The spirit appears in an unoccupied space within 5
feet of you, and you choose its stat block and appearance. If you
already have the spirits from this feature, it vanishes when the new
spirit appears. The spirit also vanishes if you die

At 11th level, your spirit gains Multiattack and its attacks counts as
magical.

choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

greater favored enemy: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons,
elementals, fiends, or giants. You gain all the benefits against this
chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy,
including an additional language. Your bonus to damage rolls against all
your favored enemies increases to +4.

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and
abilities used by a greater favored enemy.

=== *Roving*

Beginning at 6th level, your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain
a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1
temporary hit point). You can use this action a number of times equal to
your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish
a long rest.

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if
any, is decreased by 1.

wizard spell list.

*_Cantrips._*

You learn three cantrips: mage hand and two other cantrips of your
choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of
your choice at 10th level.

*_Spell Slots._*

The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of
these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You
regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a
1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm
person using either slot.

*_Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher._*

You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you
must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell
list.

The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows
when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these
spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must
be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you
reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd
level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any
school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the
wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard
spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you're
replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any
school of magic.

*_Spellcasting Ability._*

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since
you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use
your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
one.

In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action
to control the hand.

==== 9th LEVEL: Magical Ambush

Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a
spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes
against the spell this turn.

==== 13th LEVEL: Versatile Trickster

At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your mage
hand. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature
within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives
you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the
turn.

==== 17th LEVEL: Spell Thief

At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of
how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes
you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the
creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier.
The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the
spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if
it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to
be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can
cast it using your spell slots. The creature can't cast that spell until
the 8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.

=== Swashbuckler

You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed,
elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some warriors are brutes clad
in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost like a performance.
Duelists and pirates typically belong to this archetype.

A Swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapons
while safely darting away from an opponent.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Fancy Footwork

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to land a
strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you
make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make
opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Rakish Audacity

Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into battle. You can
give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma
modifier.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need
advantage on your attack roll to use Sneak Attack against a creature if
you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of
you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other
rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

==== 9th LEVEL: Panache

At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an
action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a
creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear
you, and the two of you must share a language.

If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has
disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't
make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect
lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or
affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60
feet apart.

If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is
charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly
acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do
anything harmful to it.

==== 13th LEVEL: Elegant Maneuver

Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain
advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics)
check you make during the same turn.

==== 17th LEVEL: Master Duelist

Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure
into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it
again with advantage. Once you do so, you can't use this feature again
until you finish a short or long rest.

=== Thief

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits,
cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so
do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure
seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving
your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you
normally couldn't employ.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Fast Hands

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your
Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your
thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an
Object action.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Second-Story Work

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to
climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover
increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

==== 9th LEVEL: Supreme Sneak

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check
if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

==== 13th LEVEL: Use Magic Device

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that
you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for
you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of
magic items.

==== 17th LEVEL: Thief's Reflexes

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and
quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round
of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and
your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature
when you are surprised.

*Range:* 120 feet

*Component*: V, S

| | | | |
a|
You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object within range. Make a
ranged attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6
damage. If you roll a 6 on a d6 for this spell, you can roll another d6,
and add it to the damage. Whenever you cast this spell, the maximum
number of these d6s you can add to the spell’s damage equals your
spellcasting ability modifier.

When you cast the spell you roll 1d6 to determine the damage from the
following list: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Psychic, or Thunder.

*Cantrip Upgrade.* This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach
certain Sorcerer levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th

Churning magical energy explodes in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on
a point you choose within range. When you cast the spell, you select the
type of damage dealt by the explosion: Acid,

Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder. Each creature in the
sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 6d6 damage of the chosen type.

On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Choose one
of those d6s. The number rolled on that die determines a condition
that’s applied to each creature that failed the save, as shown below. A
creature has the condition until the end of your next turn.

=== *Spellcasting*

==== *Cantrips*

You learn cantrips from the Sorcerer Spell List as the sorcerer class
table stays. Additionally, you learn the cantrip _Sorcerous Burst_ that
doesn’t count to your Cantrips Knows.

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score
Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this
class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from this class spell
list.

==== *Spell Points*

Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the
Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You
expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level,
and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell
points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when
you finish a long rest.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can
use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You
can't create another slot of the same level until you finish a long
rest.

The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a
spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level
also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though
you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you
can't do so.

psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter
the world around you by using it to control the magical energy of the
multiverse. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to
others? Or will you be a source of terror to those who feel the stab of
your mind and witness the strange manifestations of your might?

As an Aberrant Mind sorcerer, you decide how you acquired your powers.
Were you born with them? Or did an event later in life leave you shining
with psionic awareness? Consult the Aberrant Origins table for a
possible origin of your power.

*Aberrant Origins*

[width="100%",cols="6%,94%",options="header",]

|*d6* |*Origin*
|1 |You were exposed to the Far Realm's warping influence. You are
convinced that a tentacle is now growing on you, but no one else can see
it.

When you use your powers, faint motes of light sparkle around you.

|3 |You once suffered the dominating powers of an aboleth, leaving a
psychic splinter in your mind.

|4 |You were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but the ceremorphosis
never completed. And now its psionic power is yours. When you use it,
your flesh shines with a strange mucus.

|5 |As a child, you had an imaginary friend that looked like a flumph or
a strange platypus-like creature. One day, it gifted you with psionic
powers, which have ended up being not so imaginary.

|6 |Your nightmares whisper the truth to you: your psionic powers are
not your own. You draw them from your parasitic twin!
|===

==== 1st LEVEL: Psionic Spells

sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of

must be a divination or an enchantment spell from the sorcerer, warlock,
or wizard spell list.

other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand

=== Divine Soul

Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine
source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a
sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful
familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an
angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god's name.

Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a
servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.

A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some
religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a
Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to
the divine.

In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul
may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions
are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.

==== 1st LEVEL: Divine Magic

Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from the cleric
class. Choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good,
evil or neutrality. You learn gain access to the table that your
affinity specifies. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count
against your number of sorcerer spells prepared. If you later replace
this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

Additionally, you learn how to speak and write Celestial.

==== 1st LEVEL: Favored by the Gods

Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a
saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to
the total, possibly changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you
can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

==== 6th LEVEL: Empowered Healing.

Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through you can
empower healing spells. When you cast a healing spell you can increase
that healing by a roll by an amount equal to a roll of d6, the number of
d6 is your Charisma modifier. You can use this trait a number of times
equals to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), and regain all
spent uses when you finish a long rest.

==== 14th LEVEL: Divine Incarnation

=== *Shadow Sorcerer*

You are a creature of shadow, for your innate magic comes from the
Shadowfell itself. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that
place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy and transformed by
it.

The power of shadow magic casts a strange pall over your physical
presence. The spark of life that sustains you is muffled, as if it
struggles to remain viable against the dark energy that imbues your
soul. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Shadow Sorcerer
Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

==== Shadow Sorcerer Quirks

[width="100%",cols="7%,93%",options="header",]

|d6 |Quirk
|1 |You are always icy cold to the touch.

|2 |When you are asleep, you don't appear to breathe (though you must
still breathe to survive).

|3 |You barely bleed, even when badly injured.

|4 |Your heart beats once per minute. This event sometimes surprises
you.

|5 |You have trouble remembering that living creatures and corpses
should be treated differently.

|6 |You blinked. Once. Last week.
|===

==== *1st LEVEL: Eyes of the Dark*

Starting at 1st level, you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the darkness spell,
which doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. You
can see through the darkness created by the spell.

==== *1st LEVEL: Shadow Magic*

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class,
as shown on the Shadow Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a
sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of
sorcerer spells you know.

Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained
from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell
must be an abjuration or an illusion spell from the sorcerer, warlock,
or wizard spell list.

Additionally, you learn how to speak and write Undercommon.

=== Pact Boon

At 1st level, You have formed a pact with an otherworldly entity that
has bestowed magical powers upon you. You always have the *_Eldritch
Blast_* and *_Hex_* spells prepared, and you choose one of the following
boons: Pact of the Blade, Pact of the Chain, or Pact of the Tome, each
of which give you access to a cantrip that you learn and doesn’t count
against your cantrips know. You determine the identity of the entity and
choose its plane of existence, such as the Feywild, the Shadowfell, or
an Outer Plane.

You must choose from Wisdom, Intelligence or Charisma, which ability you
will use for your spellcasting ability used by your Pact Magic feature.

*Pact Weapon*

Conjuration Cantrip (Warlock)

*Casting Time:* Action

*Range:* Self

*Component*: S

*Duration*: 24 hours

| | | | |
a|
Tracing arcane sigils in the air, you conjure a Simple or Martial melee
weapon of your choice in your outstretched hand, or you create a bond
with a magic weapon you touch. The weapon you conjure or touch must lack
the Heavy property, and the spell fails if you touch a magic item that
is attuned to someone else. For the duration, the weapon grants you the
following benefits:

*Eldritch Warrior.* When you attack with the weapon, you can use your
spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls,

instead of using Strength or Dexterity. Additionally you are proficient
with medium armor for the duration.

*Proficiency.* You have proficiency with the weapon.

*Returning Weapon.* If the weapon has the Thrown property, the weapon
returns to your hand immediately after hitting or missing a target.

The spell ends early if you cast the spell again or die. When it ends, a
conjured weapon disappears, or your bond with a magic weapon stops.

*Cantrip Upgrade.* When you reach 5th level as a Warlock, you gain the
Extra Attack feature for the conjured or magic weapon only. With that
feature, you can attack twice with the weapon, instead of once, when you
take the Attack action on your turn.

*Pact Familiar*

Conjuration Cantrip (Warlock)

*Casting Time:* 1 hour

*Range:* 10 feet

*Component*: V, S

*Duration*: Instantaneous

| | | | |
a|
You summon an unearthly entity to serve you. It manifests in an
unoccupied space of your choice within range. This creature uses the
Pact Familiar stat block. If you already have a familiar from this
spell, that familiar transforms into the new one but retains its
memories; you don’t get a second Pact Familiar. Whenever you cast the
spell, choose the familiar’s creature type: Aberration (flumph or knot
of tentacles), Celestial (owl, raven, or other bird), Dragon
(pseudodragon or similar dragonet), Fey (pixie or sprite), Fiend (imp or
quasit), or Undead (shadow or skull). This choice affects the familiar’s
default appearance, as noted in the parentheses, and it determines
certain traits in its stat block. You can alter details of the
creature’s appearance each time you summon it.

*Combat.* The familiar is an ally to you and your companions, and it
obeys you. In combat, it shares your Initiative count, but it takes its
turn immediately after yours. On its turn, the familiar takes the Dodge
action and uses its Move to avoid danger, unless you use your Reaction
to command it to attack instead.

*Disappearance of the Familiar.* The familiar disappears if it drops to
0 Hit Points, if you dismiss it as a Bonus Action, or if you die. When
it disappears, it leaves behind anything it was wearing or carrying. If
you cast this spell again, you decide whether you summon the familiar
that disappeared or a different one.

*Remote Viewing.* As a Magic action, you can see what your familiar sees
and hear what it hears until the end of your next turn.

*Cantrip Upgrade.* Starting when you reach 5th level as a Warlock, you
can communicate telepathically with your familiar as long as you two are
on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through
your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your
own voice.

| | | | |
a|
Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your
hand. The book contains eldritch magic that only you can access,
granting you the following benefits:

*Cantrips and Rituals.* When the book appears, choose two cantrips, and
choose two 1st-level spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be
from any spell lists, and they must be spells you don’t already have
prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells
prepared.

*Spellcasting Focus.* You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus. The
book disappears if you cast this spell again or die.

*Cantrip Upgrade.* When you reach 5th level as a Warlock, this spell
also enhances other cantrips while the book is on your person; you can
add your Warlock spellcasting ability modifier to the damage rolls of
any cantrip you cast that doesn’t already have that modifier added to
its damage roll.

learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

==== *Spell Slots*

warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the
level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To

a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
short or long rest.

==== *Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher*

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the
warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more

choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's
Slot Level column for your level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

Your Pact Boon feature determines the spellcasting ability for the
spells you cast with your Warlock features.

____

==== *Spellcasting Focus*

spells.

=== *Eldritch Invocations*

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations,
fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical
ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. A list
of the available options can be found on the Optional Features page.
When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of
your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock
table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you
could learn at that level.

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn
it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its
prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

=== Otherworldly Patron

At 3rd level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being
chosen from the list of available patrons. Your choice grants you
features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

feature.

=== *Eldritch Versatility*

Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a
change of focus in your occult studies:

* {blank}
+
____

which you qualify.

must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level

so again.

== *Warlock Pacts*

=== The Fiend

You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a
being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such
beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately
including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon
lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils
such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and
balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the
yugoloths.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Fiend Expanded Spells

*Expanded Spell List*

[width="100%",cols="28%,72%",options="header",]
|===
|Spell Level |Spells
|1st |burning hands, command
|2nd |blindness/deafness, scorching ray
|3rd |fireball, stinking cloud
|4th |fire shield, wall of fire
|5th |flame strike, hallow
|===

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn
a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell
list for you.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Dark One's Blessing

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit
points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier +
your warlock level (minimum of 1).

==== 6th LEVEL: Dark One's Own Luck

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your
favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use
this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the
initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.

==== 10th LEVEL: Fiendish Resilience

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a
short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you
choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or
silver weapons ignores this resistance.

==== 14th LEVEL: Hurl Through Hell

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can
use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower
planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare
landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it
previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is
not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific
experience.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.

=== The Great Old One

Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to
the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space
beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in
legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge
so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in
comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be
unaware of your existence or entirely indifferent to you, but the
secrets you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it. Entities
of this type include Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the
Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great
Cthulhu; and other unfathomable beings.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Great Old One Expanded Spell List

The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when
you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock
spell list for you.

*Expanded Spells*

[width="100%",cols="21%,79%",options="header",]
|===
|Spell Level |Spells
|1st |dissonant whispers, Tasha's hideous laughter
|2nd |detect thoughts, phantasmal force
|3rd |clairvoyance, sending
|4th |dominate beast, Evard's black tentacles
|5th |dominate person, telekinesis
|===

==== 3rd Awakened Mind

Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to
touch the minds of other creatures. You can telepathically speak to any
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a
language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic
utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one
language.

==== 6th LEVEL: Entropic Ward

At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to
turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a
creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to
impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next
attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the
end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.

==== 10th LEVEL: Thought Shield

Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or
other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic
damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that
creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.

==== 14th LEVEL: Create Thrall

At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the
alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an
incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a
remove curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from
it, or you use this feature again.

You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as
the two of you are on the same plane of existence.

=== The Hexblade

You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell—a
force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of
shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these
weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The
shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form
pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those
formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the
dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.

Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these
weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that
the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to
manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Expanded Spell List

The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you
learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock
spell list for you.

*Hexblade Expanded Spells*

[width="100%",cols="24%,76%",options="header",]
|===
|*Spell Level* |*Spells*
|*1st* |*shield, wrathful smite*
|*2nd* |*blur, branding smite*
|*3rd* |*blink, elemental weapon*
|*4th* |*phantasmal killer, staggering smite*
|*5th* |*banishing smite, cone of cold*
|===

==== 3rd LEVEL: Hexblade's Curse

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on
someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30
feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if
the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse
ends, you gain the following benefits:

* {blank}
+
____
You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus
equals your proficiency bonus.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on
a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
____
* {blank}
+
____
If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock
level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).
____

You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Hex Warrior

At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm
yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields,
and martial weapons.

The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your
will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you
can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the
two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your
Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and
damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you
later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every
pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.

==== 6th LEVEL: Accursed Specter

Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay,
temporarily binding it to your service. When you slay a humanoid, you
can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, the
statistics for which are in the Monster Manual. When the specter
appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level.
Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your
verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).

The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long
rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature
again until you finish a long rest.

==== 10th LEVEL: Armor of Hexes

At 10th level, your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by
your Hexblade's Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your
reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you,
regardless of its roll.

==== 14th LEVEL: Master of Hexes

Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade's Curse from a
slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your
Hexblade's Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature
you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated.
When you apply the curse in this way, you don't regain hit points from
the death of the previously cursed creature.

=== *Spellcasting*

==== *Cantrips*

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard
spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at
higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard
table. Additionally, you learn the Prestidigitation cantrip, that
doesn’t count to your Cantrips Known.

==== *Spellbook*

At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard
spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard
spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

In case that you lose your spellbook you retain all your spells until
you use one spell, you will have to succeed a Intelligence check DC 10
or lose it. You can put your known spell into a new spellbook by a
quarter the cost and time.

==== *Preparing and Casting Spells*

The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You have prepared all the spells that are in your book. Casting a spell
doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

==== *Spellcasting Ability*

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since
you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and memorization.
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.

____
*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier +
*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier
____

==== *Ritual Casting*

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag
and you have the spell in your spellbook.

==== *Spellcasting Focus*

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard
spells.

==== *Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher*

Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your
choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for
which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your
adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your
spellbook (see "Your Spellbook").

==== *Your Spellbook*

The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the
arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual
breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might
find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell
recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a
dusty tome in an ancient library.

A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.

===== *Copying a Spell into the Book.*

When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to
your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can
spare the time to decipher and copy it.

Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form
of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the
wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand
the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook
using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp.
The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment
with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record
it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell
just like your other spells.

===== *Copying from a Spell Scroll.*

A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in
spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you
must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 +
the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully
copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is
destroyed.

===== *Replacing the Book.*

You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for
example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is
just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and
easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to
cast the spell. You need to spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level
of the copied spell.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe
the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the
remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as
normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe
place.

===== *The Book's Appearance.*

Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own
decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional
leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely
bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose
collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous
spellbook in a mishap.

=== Arcane Recovery

At 2nd level, you have learned to regain some of your magical energy by
studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you
can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level
(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two
levels worth of spell slots.

You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell
slots.

=== Cantrip Formula

At 2nd level, you have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your
spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind. Whenever
you finish a long rest and consult those formulas in your spellbook, you
can replace one wizard cantrip you know with another cantrip from the
wizard spell list.

=== *Arcane Tradition*

When you reach 3nd level, you choose an arcane tradition from the list
of available traditions, shaping your practice of magic. Your choice
grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== School Savant

At 5th level, you choose a school of magic, and you gain the following
traits:

* {blank}
+
____
The gold and time you must spend to copy a spell from your chosen school
into your spellbook is halved.
____
* {blank}
+
____
You can cast a spell from that school without spending a spell slot,
once you use this feature you can’t use it until you finish a long rest.
____

Additionally, you can’t lose the spells that are from your School of
magic.

=== *Arcane Tradition feature*

At 6th level, you gain a feature granted by your Arcane Tradition.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Arcane Tradition feature*

At 10th level, you gain a feature granted by your Arcane Tradition.

=== School Mastery

At 11th level, you gain mastery in the school you choose from your
School Savant:

==== *Abjuration*

*Arcane Ward*. you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When
you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can
simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical
ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has a
hit point maximum equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence
modifier. Whenever you or a creature that you can see at 30 feets of
you, take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage
reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage. The
ward use the resistance of the target creature.

While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic
remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher,
the ward regains a number of hit points equal to your Intelligence
modifier + twice the level of the spell.

==== *Conjuration.*

*Conjured.* you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in
your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see
within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a
side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a
non magical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical,
radiating dim light out to 5 feet.

The object remains a number of hours equal to your Wizard level, when
you use this feature again, if it takes any damage, or if it deals any
damage.

Additionally, your conjuration spell that summons a creature doesn’t
require concentration for you, but you can’t have more than 1 creature
summoned this way.

==== *Divination*.

*Portent.* glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness.
When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers
rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check
made by you or a creature that you can see at 30 feets of you, with one
of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll,
and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long
rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

==== *Enchantment*.

*Split Enchantment.* When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or
higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a number
of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Additionally, when you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more
creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains
unaware of being charmed.

==== *Evocation*.

*Overchannel*.When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th-level that
deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. Once you cast
a spell this way, you can’t do it again until you finish a long rest.

==== *Illusion*.

*Illusory Self*. you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an
instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an
attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the
illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack
automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

You can use this trait twice and regain any spent use when you finish a
long rest.

Additionally, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1
minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that
illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion),
provided that you can see the illusion.

==== *Necromancy*.

*Undead Thralls*. you add the animated dead spell to your spellbook if
it is not there already. When you cast animate dead, you can target one
additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton,
as appropriate.

Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has
additional benefits:

* {blank}
+
____
The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your
wizard level.
____
* {blank}
+
____
The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.
____

Additionally, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even
those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead
that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a
Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds,
you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly
to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has
an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If
it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it
can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds
and breaks free.

==== *Transtumation*.

*Transmuter's Stone*. You can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's
stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone
yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of
your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When
you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:

* {blank}
+
____
Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter 8.
____
* {blank}
+
____
An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Proficiency in Constitution saving throws.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your
choice whenever you choose this benefit).
____

Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can
change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.

If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to
function

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Arcane Tradition feature*

At 14th level, you gain a feature granted by your Arcane Tradition.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== *Spell Mastery*

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that
you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a
2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those
spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you
have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level,
you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells
you chose for different spells of the same levels.

=== *Ability Score Improvement*

When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this
feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.

=== Create Spell

When you reach 20th level, you are able to create new spells, for that
you must choose a spell that you know from your spellbook and perform a
ritual that takes 1 hour to perform for each level of the spell. You
need to use an Arcane Focus worth at least 1,000 gp for each level of
the spell. Additionally you need to spend a 4th level spell slot for
each component that you want to modify above the 4th level. Then you can
choose which component to modify from the following list:

* {blank}
+
____
*Components*. Remove one of the spell’s components: Verbal, Somatic, or
Material. You can’t remove the Material component of a spell that
consumes that component.
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Concentration*. If the spell requires Concentration, damage can’t break
your Concentration on the spell.
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Damage Type*. If the spell has a damage type, replace it with one of
the following types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Poison, or
Thunder. If the spell has multiple damage types, you can change only one
of them.
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Range*. If the spell has a range of at least 5 feet and doesn’t have a
range of Self, increase its range by a number of feet equal to 30 times
your Wizard level.
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Ritual*. If the spell lacks the Ritual tag and has a casting time of at
least 10 minutes, give it the Ritual tag.
____
* {blank}
+
____
*Targets*. If the spell affects one or more creatures and doesn’t have a
range of Self, it now affects only your allies or enemies (choose which
when you modify the spell).
____

When you finish the spell appears in your spellbook, you have it
prepared and doesn’t count for your spell prepared. This spell has the
name of your choice.

== *Wizard Tradition*

=== Bladesinging

Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay
and dance. Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted
by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways.

In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers
that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into
devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a
bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful
experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing
blade.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Training in War and Song (Bladesinging)

When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with
light armor, and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee
weapon of your choice.

You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already
have it.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Bladesong

Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a secret elven magic called the
Bladesong, provided you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a
shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1
minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or
heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with
a weapon. You can also dismiss Bladesong at any time you choose (no
action required).

While your bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:

* {blank}
+
____
You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum
of +1).
____
* {blank}
+
____
Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
____
* {blank}
+
____
You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
____
* {blank}
+
____
You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throws you make to maintain
https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#concentration_phb[[.underline]#concentration#]
on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
____

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long
rest.

===== Bladesinger Styles

From its inception as a martial and magical art, Bladesinging has been
tied to the sword, more specifically the longsword. Yet many generations
of study gave rise to various styles of Bladesinging based on the melee
weapon employed. The techniques of these styles are passed from master
to students in small schools, some of which have a building dedicated to
instruction. Even the newest styles are hundreds of years old, but are
still taught by their original creators due to the long lives of elves.
Most schools of Bladesinging are in Evermeet or Evereska. One was
started in Myth Drannor, but the city's destruction has scattered those
students who survived.

Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on the type of
weapon employed, and each is associated with a category of animal.
Within that style are specializations named after specific animal types,
based on the types of spells employed, the techniques of the master, and
the particular weapon used. Bladesingers who apprentice to a master
typically get a tattoo of their chosen style's animal. Some bladesingers
learn multiple styles and bear many tattoos, wearing a warning on their
skin of their deadly skills.

*Cat.*

Styles that employ a sword belong to this family. The lion style, the
eldest, trains practitioners in the use of the longsword and doesn't
favor any particular type of spells. Leopard style focuses on the
shortsword and spells of illusion and stealth. Red tiger, a style just
three centuries old, has its bladesingers using the scimitar in a
whirling dance of defense from which they launch into sudden leaps and
attacks.

*Bird.*

Styles that focus on the use of a hafted weapon, such as an axe or
hammer, have been grouped together as bird styles, yet they vary wildly.
All relatively new styles, they use weapons not typically favored by
elves. Eagle-style bladesingers use small handaxes, and many maneuvers
in the style focus on fluid ways to throw the weapon and draw a new one.
Raven style uses a war pick, and spells associated with it grant the
bladesinger more agility in combat.

*Snake.*

Practitioners of these styles use a flail, chain, or whip. Viper style
uses a whip, despite its inelegance as a weapon, and has almost as long
a history as the lion style. Its masters punctuate their bladesong with
a stunningly rapid rhythm of whip cracks, which can keep many foes at
bay and allow the bladesinger space to cast the cruel spells of poison
and disease favored by the style.

==== 6th LEVEL: Extra Attack

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of
your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

==== 10th LEVEL: Song of Defense

Beginning at 10th level, you can direct your magic to absorb damage
while your bladesong is active. When you take damage, you can use your
reaction to expend one spell slot and reduce that damage to you by an
amount equal to five times the spell's slot level.

==== 14th LEVEL: Song of Victory

Starting at 14th level, you add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of
+1) to the damage of your melee weapon attacks while your Bladesong is
active.

=== Chronurgy Magic

Focusing on the manipulation of time, those who follow the Chronurgy
tradition learn to alter the pace of reality to their liking. Using the
ramping of anticipatory dunamis energy, these mages can bend the flow of
time as adroitly as a skilled musician plays an instrument, lending
themselves and their allies an advantage in the blink of an eye.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Chronal Shift

You can magically exert limited control over the flow of time around a
creature. As a reaction, after you or a creature you can see within 30
feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw,
you can force the creature to reroll. You make this decision after you
see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result
of the new roll.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence
modifier, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Temporal Awareness

You can add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative rolls.

==== 6th LEVEL: Momentary Stasis

As an action, you can magically force a Large or smaller creature you
can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw
against your spell save DC. Unless the saving throw is a success, the
creature is encased in a field of magical energy until the end of your
next turn or until the creature takes any damage. While encased in this
way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long
rest.

==== 10th LEVEL: Arcane Abeyance

When you cast a spell using a spell slot of 4th level or lower, you can
condense the spell's magic into a mote. The spell is frozen in time at
the moment of casting and held within a gray bead for 12 hours. This
bead is a Tiny object with AC 15 and 1 hit point, and it is immune to
poison and psychic damage. When the duration ends, or if the bead is
destroyed, it vanishes in a flash of light, and the spell is lost.

A creature holding the bead can use its action to release the spell
within, whereupon the bead disappears. The spell uses your spell attack
bonus and save DC, and the spell treats the creature who released it as
the caster for all other purposes.

Once you create a bead with this feature, you can't do so again until
you finish a short or long rest.

==== 14th LEVEL: Convergent Future

You can peer through possible futures and magically pull one of them
into events around you, ensuring a particular outcome. When you or a
creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an
ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to ignore
the die roll and decide whether the number rolled is the minimum needed
to succeed or one less than that number (your choice).

When you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
long rest.

=== Order of Scribes

Magic of the book-that's what many folk call wizardry. The name is apt,
given how much time wizards spend poring over tomes and penning theories
about the nature of magic. It's rare to see wizards traveling without
books and scrolls sprouting from their bags, and a wizard would go to
great lengths to plumb an archive of ancient knowledge.

Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the most bookish. It takes many
forms in different worlds, but its primary mission is the same
everywhere: recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can flourish.
And while all wizards value spellbooks, a wizard in the Order of Scribes
magically awakens their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All
wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks to theirs!

==== 3rd LEVEL: Wizardly Quill

As a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free
hand. The magic quill has the following properties:

* {blank}
+
____
The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink
in a color of your choice on the writing surface.
____
* {blank}
+
____
The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook equals 2
minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.
____
* {blank}
+
____
You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather
over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of
you.
____

This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die.

==== 3rd LEVEL: Awakened Spellbook

Using specially prepared inks and ancient incantations passed down by
your wizardly order, you have awakened an arcane sentience within your
spellbook.

While you are holding the book, it grants you the following benefits:

* {blank}
+
____
You can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
____
* {blank}
+
____
When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily
replace its damage type with a type that appears in another spell in
your spellbook, which magically alters the spell's formula for this
casting only. The latter spell must be of the same level as the spell
slot you expend.
____
* {blank}
+
____
When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal
casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this
benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
____

If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest
by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a
magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the rest, your
spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the
consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells.
If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from
its pages.

==== 6th LEVEL: Manifest Mind

You can conjure forth the mind of your Awakened Spellbook. As a bonus
action while the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to
manifest as a Tiny spectral object, hovering in an unoccupied space of
your choice within 60 feet of you. The spectral mind is intangible and
doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It
looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past
(your choice).

While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has
darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The mind can telepathically share
with you what it sees and hears (no action required).

Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you
were in the spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its
senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your
proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a
long rest.

As a bonus action, you can cause the spectral mind to hover up to 30
feet to an unoccupied space that you or it can see. It can pass through
creatures but not objects.

The spectral mind stops manifesting if it is ever more than 300 feet
away from you, if someone casts dispel magic on it, if the Awakened
Spellbook is destroyed, if you die, or if you dismiss the spectral mind
as a bonus action.

Once you conjure the mind, you can't do so again until you finish a long
rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to conjure it again.

==== 10th LEVEL: Master Scrivener

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by
touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and
causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the
scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the
scroll.

The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting
time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced,
counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from
the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to
anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or
when you finish your next long rest.

You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the
treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The gold and time you
must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly
Quill.

==== 14th LEVEL: One with the Word

Your connection to your Awakened Spellbook has become so profound that
your soul has become entwined with it. While the book is on your person,
you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks, as the spellbook
helps you remember magical lore.

Moreover, if you take damage while your spellbook's mind is manifested,
you can prevent all of that damage to you by using your reaction to
dismiss the spectral mind, using its magic to save yourself. Then roll
3d6. The spellbook temporarily loses spells of your choice that have a
combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. For example, if the
roll's total is 9, spells vanish from the book that have a combined
level of at least 9, which could mean one 9th-level spell, three
3rd-level spells, or some other combination. If there aren't enough
spells in the book to cover this cost, you drop to 0 hit points.

Until you finish 1d6 long rests, you are incapable of casting the lost
spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. After
you finish the required number of rests, the spells reappear in the
spellbook.

Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a
long rest.
