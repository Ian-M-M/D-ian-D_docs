== Bussines Tasks and Downtime

The downtimes can be done during adventures by the majordomo or between adventures by the players. Additionaly, others special positions can have access to the bussines task given that they are at least rank 3 or higher.

=== Bussines Tasks: Explore Territory
No matter how densely populated or remote and wild the territory in which a franchise is licensed to operate, that territory has secrets. Characters and franchise staff can explore their licensed territory in search of useful features, hidden lairs, resources, and creatures that can be engaged in beneficial service. (Or, you know, sold for parts. If you're okay with that). Exploration can be done any number of times in a franchise's territory, representing new areas being explored, new discoveries, or elements that have changed since the last exploration.

*Resources.* Exploring a portion of a licensed territory requires at least one workweek of effort and incurs 200 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more time and money increases the chance that the expedition finds something of use to the franchise.

*Resolution.* A character or staff member directing the expedition makes a Wisdom (Survival) check to determine the outcome. This check gains a +2 bonus if a character with the cartographer or occultant position is part of the expedition, a +1 bonus for each workweek beyond the first that is spent exploring, and a +1 bonus for every additional 200 gp spent over the baseline expenses. A maximum bonus of +10 can be applied to this check. The total of the check determines the outcome, as shown on the Exploration Discoveries table.

|======================================
| Check Total | Discovery              
| 1–5         | Major threat*          
| 6–10        | Minor threat*          
| 11–15       | No discovery of note   
| 16–20       | Natural feature        
| 21–25       | New customers          
| 26–30       | Ally or useful monster 
| 31+         | Expanded benefit                 
|======================================
*Might involve a rival

*Major Threat.* A result on the table indicating a major threat represents a discovery, event, or entity that might completely undo a franchise's ability to do business—or destroy it altogether. Such threats might include the discovery of a massing orc tribe, or a dragon entering the area to raid the franchise's trade routes. The franchise's monthly costs increase by 50 percent until the threat is resolved, as determined by the DM.

*Minor Threat.* A minor threat to the franchise involves uncovering a danger that can disrupt the characters' ability to conduct business effectively. Such threats might arise from stumbling upon the lair of a monster, learning of the machinations of a noble, or discovering a rival's outpost. The franchise's monthly costs increase by 25 percent until the threat is resolved, as determined by the DM.

*Natural Feature.* The expedition could locate timber, precious metals, or other valuable natural resources; a feature that serves as a lookout or offers defensive value; a location that can serve as a safe house; or the like. Valuable resources lower a franchise's monthly costs by 25 percent for 1d4 + 1 months. Other natural features can offer material benefits in future gaming sessions. For example, a tall spire of rock could serve as a watchtower, allowing the franchise to gain advance warning of any large-scale forces moving through their territory. A cave network acting as a safe house could allow the franchise to conceal goods or people in times of trouble.

*New Customers.* A new settlement is discovered in the territory, and the people there are eager to deal. These could be newcomers settling the area or a previously unnoticed village or group of farmsteads. The presence of new customers lowers franchise costs by 25 percent for 2d4 months before rivals catch wind of them.

*Ally or Useful Monster.* The dwelling of a useful ally, such as a sage or a former franchise member, is discovered. This ally can become a source of lore, providing insights into one or more campaign secrets—for a low, low fee of 100 gp times the franchise tier for each secret. The party can also make one-time use of the ally to lower franchise costs by 50 percent for 1d4 months, after which the ally departs.
The expedition could instead locate a monster that is either willing to help the party or can be tamed. The challenge rating of the monster is typically equal to franchise rank, and providing for the monster's needs costs 100 gp per month. This monster could serve as a scout or spy, alerting the franchise to danger in its territory. Or it could serve as a mount or guardian and be based in the franchise headquarters. Such a monster remains with the franchise as long as its costs are covered and it is treated well.

*Expanded Benefit.* The DM chooses whether the expedition turns up a natural feature, new customers, or an ally or useful monster, then increases the benefit or reduces the cost of that discovery. Natural resources might be found in greater abundance, an ally might provide secrets for half the normal fee, a monster might be of a higher challenge rating than normal, and so on.

*Complications.* A result of 1–10 on the Exploration Discoveries table is its own complication, but the DM can add unexpected side effects to a successful result by choosing from or rolling on the Explore Territory Complications table.

=== Bussines Tasks: Franchise Restructuring
A growing franchise often needs fine-tuning to improve its operations and remain lean and capable. Efficiency measures, bold new paradigms, shiny business plans, internal audits, and inventory management can be key to new profits. The best plans often end up creating an auxiliary market for "how-to" books, such as Can't-Miss Principles of Franchise Reinvisionary Strategery and What to Inquire about How to Acquire. In some campaigns, Head Office might periodically require this task to ensure that a franchise grows effectively.

*Resources.* Boldly restructuring a franchise requires at least two workweeks of effort. The franchise must also spend 100 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more time and money increases the characters' chance to effectively restructure their franchise.

*Resolution.* Characters or staff members in charge of the restructuring make two ability checks with a DC of 13 + franchise rank. First, a character or staff member must succeed at either an Intelligence (History) or Wisdom (Insight) check to select the right vision or identify the right areas to innovate. This check gains a +1 bonus for every character with the loremonger or hoardsperson position in the franchise, and an additional +1 bonus if the character making the check has one of those positions.
A character or staff member must then make a Charisma (Deception, Performance, or Persuasion) check to get all other characters and staff on board with the prescribed changes. This check gains a +1 bonus for each decisionist or secretarian in the franchise, and an additional +1 bonus if the character making the check has one of those positions.

All checks gain a +1 bonus for every two workweeks beyond the initial time that is spent undertaking this activity. Each check also gains a +1 bonus for every additional 100 gp spent over the baseline expenses. A maximum bonus of +10 can be applied to each check.

The total number of successes determines the outcome of the activity, as noted on the Franchise Restructuring table.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|==================================================================================================================================
| Successes | Benefit                                                                                                              
| 0         | The restructuring plan is a failure. The franchise's monthly costs increase by 20 percent for 1 month.               
| 1         | The restructuring plan provides minor benefits. The franchise's monthly costs decrease by 10 percent for 1d4 months. 
| 2         | The restructuring plan provides strong benefits. The franchise's monthly costs decrease by 20 percent for 1d4 months.
|==================================================================================================================================

*Complications.* A result of 0 successes typically indicates that the failed restructuring results in a complication. At the DM's discretion, even a successful outcome might have unexpected side effects. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Franchise Restructuring Complications table.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|==========================================================================================================================================================================================================
| d6 | Complication
| 1  | The restructuring plan has too many buzzwords and acronyms. The resulting confusion sees shipments or staff sent to dangerous locations. A side trek adventure is required to recover the lost goods or personnel. 
| 2  | The changes to the franchise alienate an important staff member, who takes one of the franchise's best practices or secrets to a rival.*
| 3  | The search for efficiency uncovers a previously unrecognized issue, such as corruption, problems with staff dynamics, or influence from a rival.*
| 4  | An audit reveals that one of the staff members was a spy, feeding secrets to a rival. The spy escapes, possibly inspiring a side trek adventure to catch them.*
| 5  | The restructuring efforts produce lingering chaos. The next two times a check is made for a downtime or franchise activity in the campaign, the check is made with disadvantage.
| 6  | A staff member becomes outraged by the changes and secretly begins to undermine the franchise. The characters must uncover the culprit and decide how to deal with them.*

=== Bussines Tasks: Headquarters Modification
Major headquarters modifications are made as a regular part of franchise advancement (see "Franchise Advancement" earlier in this chapter). But it's sometimes desirable to update a previous modification in ways that don't provide any additional mechanical benefits.

Characters and franchise staff members can use this activity to modify an existing headquarters feature. This change is subject to DM approval, and is typically done within the same feature category, such as swapping one weapon option for another. In response to pressing need, the DM might allow a franchise to swap options between categories, such as losing a weapon option in favor of an arcane option. The DM can limit how often this activity is used.

*Resources.* Once a modification is approved, this activity requires the involvement of the franchise's majordomo and at least one other character or staff member. This team must dedicate at least three workweeks to this activity, and the franchise must spend 1,000 gp per franchise rank to cover expenses. The DM might also require a side trek to gather necessary materials or hire specialist labor before the activity can be commenced.

*Resolution.* One character or the majordomo acts as the lead for this activity, making an Intelligence (Arcana or History) check to draft the modifications. A character or the majordomo must then make two ability checks to complete the modifications, using either Strength (Athletics) or an Intelligence check using appropriate tools. With DM approval, a different ability and skill appropriate for the modification can be substituted for any of the checks.

Each check receives a +1 bonus for every two staff participating who are skilled hirelings, and a +1 bonus if any participant has the cartographer, loremonger, or hoardsperson position. The number of successes is compared to the Headquarters Modification table.

Headquarters Modification
[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
| Successes | Benefit
| 0         | The modification fails, and the franchise loose 2 Bussines Die.
| 1         | The modification fails, and the franchise loose 1 Bussines Die.
| 2         | The modification succeeds but incurs a cost overrun of 100 gp. The modification also has a minor drawback, as determined by the DM.
| 3         | The modification succeeds with no cost overruns or drawbacks.   
|===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

*Complications.* A result of 0 successes or 1 success automatically creates a complication. Other results might create a complication at the DM's determination. The DM can select a complication or roll on the Headquarters Modification Complications table.

| 1  | An accident during the modification injures a franchise staff member. That NPC's family demands compensation equal to 100 gp per franchise rank. It might be possible to instead appease the family by performing a service.
| 2  | A spy makes a copy of the plans for the modification, learning its function and taking that information back to a rival organization.*
| 3  | The modification was based on information originating with a rival. If the modification failed, the plans were intentionally faulty. If it succeeded, the characters detected the fault, but must decide how to respond to the attempted sabotage.*    
| 4  | A local official insists that permits were needed for the modification, and demands payment or a favor to make the problem go away.*
| 5  | The work causes the franchise headquarters to develop a quirk, such as strange noises, unwelcome smells, weird vibrations while mobile, and the like. Resolving the problem might require consulting a sage or an expert in headquarters construction. 
| 6  | The modification work uncovers a previously unknown problem with the headquarters, such as a structural defect, a dormant monster, bodies interred in the foundations, a concealed cursed item, and so forth.

=== Bussines Tasks: Marketeering
Every successful franchise knows that brands require constant management. Developing new markets, shaping catchy slogans, and surveying and engaging customers can all create new sources of revenue. Should you write and sell exciting chapbook serials based on the exploits of Omin, Jim, Môrgæn, and Viari? Should you sell a complex investment scheme to a city's guild masters? Should you create a branded stage production based on your franchise's exciting adventures, with a line of clothing to match? All those things and more are encompassed by the fine art of marketeering.

*Resources.* The players must first sketch out their marketeering plan and present it to the DM. A character or franchise staff member must spend at least one workweek to engage in marketeering, and must spend 100 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more money increases the chance of the plan's success.

*Resolution.* A marketeering effort requires three ability checks, representing drafting the campaign, launching the campaign, and managing its success. Any of the characters or staff members involved in the marketeering can make a check. The DM decides which abilities and skills are applicable, based on the marketeering plan. For example, a plan involving selling a new line of religious items might require an Intelligence (Religion) check to draft the idea and develop the products, a Charisma (Deception) check to convince local temples to promote the idea, and a Charisma (Persuasion) check to ensure the plan receives continued support.

Each check gains a +1 bonus for each additional 100 gp per franchise rank spent above the baseline expenses. When additional gold is spent, the character making the checks determines which checks the bonuses apply to. Additional gold can be spent at any point in the process, allowing the franchise to put more effort into subsequent checks if earlier checks are less than successful. If the character making the check has the obviator or secretarian position, they receive an additional +1 bonus to each check. A maximum bonus of +5 can be applied to each check.

The DC of each check is determined randomly, reflecting the always-unpredictable conditions of the market. The DM rolls 2d10 + 5 for the DC, generating a separate result for each check. The total number of successes determines the outcome of the activity, as noted on the Marketeering table.

Marketeering
[cols="2*", options="header"]
|=================================================================================================================================
| Successes | Benefit
| 0         | The marketeering plan fails. The bussiness loose 2 Bussines Die.
| 1         | The marketeering plan provides no improvements or setbacks.
| 2         | The marketeering plan provides moderate benefits. The company gains 1 Bussines Die. 
| 3         | The marketeering plan is a complete success. The company gains 2 Bussines Die. 
|=================================================================================================================================

*Complications.* A result of 0 successes or 1 success typically indicates that the marketeering plan incurs a complication. However, even a successful result can trigger a complication at the DM's determination. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Marketeering Complications table.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
| d8 | Complication
| 1  | The marketeering plan attracts the attention of Head Office, where someone absolutely hates it. A NPC is sent to oversee the franchise "for a while," with an outcome determined by the DM.*                                    
| 2  | Marketeering materials go missing right before launch, forcing the franchise to recreate them at the last minute. This might incur additional baseline costs or affect the reduction of franchise costs, as the DM determines.* 
| 3  | Just as the marketeering plan is released to the public, the characters realize that a competing group released a surprisingly similar plan just a tenday previous. Customers now think the franchise is copying its rival.*
| 4  | The marketeering's message alienates or offends a crucial demographic. Protests spring up, and the affected group demands reparations.
| 5  | A local official or noble begins to look into claims of deceptive advertising tactics or questionable hiring practices related to the marketeering plan.*
| 6  | The marketeering plan creates great interest—but unfortunately steers customers toward similar products or services offered by a competitor.*
| 7  | The catchphrase or theme song of the marketeering campaign is a surprise hit, and everyone repeats it endlessly! Until they tire of it and begin blaming the franchise for mental trauma.
| 8  | The marketeering plan is undermined by rumors of a problem with the product or service, causing it to be dangerous to anyone using it.*

=== Bussines Tasks: Philanthropic Enterprise
It can feel great to give to charity and help those in need. Pretending to care about others can also be a great way to earn favor with governments and nobility, gain tax write-offs, or win over customers. Head Office might suggest (or even require) that a franchise undertake this activity if it has recently gained negative publicity or been discovered to engage in shady activities.

Franchise members should select a philanthropic cause related to a nearby area, settlement, or group of people. Example causes include such efforts as picking up trash from roads or forests, improving schools, and raising funds for victims of a recent disaster. (That last one is an especially good idea if the disaster was caused by the franchise). Success benefits the franchise by helping the selected cause—or at least giving the appearance of having done so. Failure might worsen both the underlying issue and the franchise's reputation.

*Resources.* The philanthropic exercise activity requires at least one workweek of effort, and incurs 50 gp per franchise rank in expenses.

*Resolution.* One character or staff member involved in the philanthropic enterprise makes an ability check determined by the DM. A Charisma check using the character's choice of skill is often appropriate, but the DM might decide that a specific philanthropic approach requires a different ability and skill. A character with the documancer or occultant position gains a +1 bonus to the check. The total of the check determines the outcome, as shown on the Philanthropic Enterprise table.
Philanthropic Enterprise
[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
| Check Total | Result
| 1–5         | The philanthropic enterprise is a disaster. The cause is left severely worse off, and literally everyone blames the franchise.
| 6–10        | The cause shows no real improvement, and people are slow to accept the franchise's claims of wanting to help.
| 11–15       | The franchise is praised for its help in improving the chosen cause. Donations to the cause pour in, allowing the franchise to skim an honorarium of 200 gp.
| 16–20       | The cause shows serious improvement, and the franchise is heralded for its actions. Donations to the cause pour in, allowing the franchise to skim a management fee of 500 gp.
| 21+         | The cause shows remarkable improvement, and the franchise is credited for all but fully resolving the issue. Local officials provide a tax break, reducing the franchise's monthly costs by 20 percent for 2 months.
|===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

*Complications.* A result of 1–5 on the Philanthropic Enterprise table automatically generates a complication. But the DM can decide that even success might have drawbacks, either choosing or rolling for a complication on the Philanthropic Enterprise Complications table.

| 3  | A group of individuals objects to the franchise's efforts, believing that the problem underlying the selected cause is part of the natural order. The group actively tries to convince others of the terrible side effects (real or otherwise) of the franchise's philanthropy.*
| 4  | Another philanthropic group is already involved in the franchise's cause. That group tries to cast the franchise's efforts as ineffective and insincere.*
| 5  | Hearing of the franchise's good works, people who are affected by some other issue requiring philanthropic assistance show up at franchise headquarters in huge numbers.
| 6  | Members of the franchise work with an established group to perform the philanthropic enterprise. But it soon becomes clear that the group is a sham—and that local officials are looking into their activities. The characters need to fix the situation, or risk being implicated in scandal by association.*

=== Bussines Tasks: Scrutineering
As a member of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, you scoff at those who limit their intelligence-gathering activities to mere research or sagery. The scrutineering activity covers basic research easily enough (finding a new profitable venture, learning what pleases Head Office, amassing lore about a site or monster, and so forth). But it can also expand across a much broader range of activities. You might engage ("kidnap" is such a harsh word) members of a rival group, learn the secrets of a stronghold known only to those who built it, assess an organization's business model to determine its weaknesses, or lay rightful claim to any information that might benefit your franchise in some way.

Resources. The DM determines what resources are required for any particular scrutineering goal, including access to specific people or places. Once that access has been gained, this activity requires at least one workweek of effort and 100 gp per franchise rank spent on bribes, materials, and other expenses. Spending more money increases the chance for successful scrutineering.
Resolution. The character or staff member overseeing the activity makes an Intelligence check, and can make use of a skill appropriate to the scrutineering activity at the DM's discretion. This check gains a +1 bonus per 100 gp spent beyond the baseline expenses. A character with the documancer position gains a +1 bonus to the check. A maximum bonus of +10 can be applied to this check. The total of the check determines the outcome, as shown on the Scrutineering table.

| Check Total | Outcome                        
| 1–5         | No effect.                     
| 6–10        | You learn one piece of lore.   
| 11–20       | You learn two pieces of lore.  
| 21+         | You learn three pieces of lore.
|==============================================
Each piece of lore you uncover through scrutineering might cover specific details about a creature or NPC, how to thwart the defenses of a stronghold or office, the rituals or magic items employed by a mystical order, and so forth. The DM makes the final decision regarding what information is revealed by scrutineering.

Complications. Whenever this activity is undertaken, the DM determines whether a complication is warranted. Even if the information you uncover with scrutineering is accurate, additional things you didn't learn might complicate your understanding. Your attempts to uncover secret information might also be thwarted by those intent on keeping those secrets. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Scrutineering Complications table.

| 5  | Scrutineering attempts attract the attention of officials, nobles, or another faction or rival who were previously unaware of the franchise.*

=== Bussines Tasks: Shady Business Practice
The quickest path to success often runs straight through the thickets of questionable legality. Franchises that can overcome the morally dubious aspects of certain enterprises—and can deal with the risk of being caught engaging in those enterprises—might wish to consider such time-honored practices as back-of-the-wagon discount sales, fly-by-night gambling halls, highway robbery, racketeering, and pyramid schemes. Shady business practices can also include corporate espionage against rivals and other Acq Inc franchises, including stealing goods or sabotaging commercial efforts.

*Resources.* An intended shady business practice is detailed by the players and approved by the DM. Any shady business practice requires at least two workweeks of effort, plus 50 gp per franchise rank in expenses to set up the scheme.

*Resolution.* A shady business practice requires three ability checks, reflecting the ongoing progress of the chosen scheme. Any of the characters or staff members involved in the shady business practice can make a check. The abilities and skills applicable for each check are determined by the DM, reflecting the selected scheme and the ongoing narrative. For example, an attempt to set up a fly-by-night casino might require an Intelligence (Investigation) check to case a town for a suitable location, a Wisdom or Charisma check making use of gaming set proficiency to run the operation, and a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to get away with the profits. At the DM's determination, each check gains a +1 bonus if the character making the check has a background appropriate to the shady activity.
The DC of each check is determined randomly, reflecting the risky nature of criminal enterprises. The DM rolls 2d10 + 5 for the DC, generating a separate result for each check. The total number of successes determines the outcome of the activity, as noted on the Shady Business Practice table.

Some outcomes of shady business provide an additional benefit, chosen by the DM and relating to the characters' chosen enterprise. For example, a franchise engaged in corporate espionage might gain insight into a rival, while a franchise selling black-market goods might learn the name of a corrupt government official.

| 2         | The shady business practice is a moderate success, providing 100 gp in profits per franchise rank. Additionally, the franchise gains a minor benefit related to the enterprise. 
| 3         | The shady business practice is a full success, providing 150 gp in profits per franchise rank. Additionally, the franchise gains a major benefit related to the enterprise.     
|=============================================================================================================================================================================================

*Complications.* Achieving 0 successes automatically generates a complication, but the DM might decide that any illicit enterprise runs the risk of unforeseen circumstances. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Shady Business Practice Complications table.

=== Bussines Tasks: Schmoozing
The schmoozing activity is more than just random carousing, chatting people up at society parties, or pumping strangers for information over copious drinks. (Full disclosure: copious drinks are often still a part of the bigger schmoozing picture.) For characters in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, schmoozing is a carefully focused engagement of bargaining and influence, designed to harvest contacts important to a franchise's interests.

*Resources.* Schmoozing covers at least one workweek of interactions. Characters or staff members undertaking this activity must look and play the part of the confident franchisee—dressing well, spending money, giving gifts to new friends, and so forth. Schmoozing with laborers and other working-class folk might incur expenses of 10 gp per franchise rank, with expenses escalating to 100 gp or more per franchise rank for schmoozing professionals and business rivals. Schmoozing at the highest level with nobles or ranking members of a faction might incur expenses of 250 gp or more per franchise rank as the character or staff member attempts to put on an impressive social display.

*Resolution.* The character or staff member engaging in schmoozing determines whether they want to establish relations with specific NPCs or with any general representative of a group. The character makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine the effectiveness of their schmoozing, as noted on the Schmoozing table. A character with the obviator position gains a +1 bonus to the check. A character with a background related to those they attempt to schmooze gains a +1 bonus to the check (a criminal schmoozing other criminals, a guild artisan schmoozing a guild master, and so forth).

Schmoozing
[cols="2*", options="header"]
|==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
| Check Total | Result
| 1–5         | The character's failed schmoozing brings the franchise into disrepute. Any further checks made for the franchise to schmooze NPCs from the same group or organization are made with disadvantage.
| 6–10        | The character becomes known to those they schmooze, but gains no immediate benefit. If the character undertakes this activity again within the same group or social circle, the next check to schmooze is made with advantage. 
| 11–15       | The character successfully establishes the desired contacts, and is treated as a confidante of those they schmoozed.
| 16–20       | The character establishes the desired contacts and is treated as a trusted friend.
| 21+         | The character establishes the desired contacts and gains a favor as a result of their schmoozing skill.
|==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

If contacts are successfully made, the DM determines which NPCs the franchise is able to ingratiate itself with, how long those relationships last, and what kinds of benefits the franchise might gain. Some schmoozed NPCs might provide only a single minor benefit to the franchise before realizing the one-sided nature of the relationship. Others might hang around wanting to help the franchise for years—whether the characters want them to or not.

*Complications.* A check of 5 or lower made to schmooze automatically triggers a complication. Because the stakes of schmoozing are often high, the DM might decide to have any successful schmooze attempt come with a potential downside. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Schmoozing Complications table.

| d6 | Complication
| 1  | A different group notices the character's schmoozing attempts. Agents threaten to expose the franchise's ulterior motives unless the characters perform a favor or pay a bribe.*
| 2  | To win over a potential contact, the schmoozing character or staff member swore to participate in an initiation ritual from the contact's group... without first learning the nature of that ritual.
| 3  | A contact becomes convinced that the schmoozing character or staff member intends to leave the franchise and join the contact's organization. It's clear that they'll become hurt or angry when they learn the truth. 
| 4  | In the attempt to win over a contact, it was necessary to reveal one of the franchise's secrets.*
| 5  | The character or staff member regrets giving a contact a personal item, a drop of blood, or a lock of hair. It seemed like a great idea at the time.*
| 6  | Shortly after schmoozing, the character or staff member receives a love letter from a contact—whether that interest is reciprocated or not.*

=== Bussines Tasks: Team Building
The frenetic pace of adventuring and running a franchise sometimes covers up underlying issues. Has the party's cleric accidentally started worshiping a dark god? Is the majordomo at odds with the occultant's habit of displaying entrails in the great hall? Is the fighter questioning their life choices? The team building activity can help characters work through problems, settle differences, and adjust the work-life balance. In the end, everyone ends up with a healthier working relationship. Or at least that's the plan.

At the DM's determination, characters might be directed by Head Office to run this activity each time a new franchise rank is gained, or during times of exceptional chaos or uncertainty.

*Resources.* Team building requires the involvement of at least two characters, or a character and a staff member. Those individuals must dedicate at least one workweek to this activity, whose particulars are worked out by participating players and the DM. The team building exercise might be a trust-inspiring ropes course, an emotional "resolve your issues" workshop, a meeting with an NPC spiritual guide, or any other suitable endeavor. Setting up the exercise incurs expenses of from 50 gp to 250 gp per franchise rank, as determined by the DM.

*Resolution.* Each character or staff member participating in team building chooses another participant, then creates a negative story connection to a bond, ideal, or similar element of that participant's backstory. The players come up with such connections for their own characters. The DM creates connections for franchise staff, either on their own or in consultation with the players. (Characters and staff members do not need to pair up. If everyone else in the franchise has a particular problem with one character, so be it.)
Each character and staff member then makes a Wisdom (Insight) check. With the DM's approval, different ability checks and skills might be allowed if they relate to the specifics of the team building exercise. A participant has advantage on their check if the DM decides the story connection was particularly clever or well roleplayed. All checks gain a +1 bonus if one of the characters taking part in the activity is a decisionist.

Each check is compared to the Team Building table. The outcome of the check can help redefine the relationships between individual characters, and can establish the tone of roleplaying between characters and franchise staff. Some outcomes also involve a team building memory that provides a potent benefit (see below).

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
| Check Total | Benefit
| 1–5         | The participant uncovers deep-seated issues between themself and their chosen partner. If this is a character, they have disadvantage on ability checks made in the presence of the partner until the character undertakes this activity again. If this is a staff member, they are traumatized and leave the franchise unless the characters can convince them to stay. 
| 6–10        | The participant did not benefit from the team building exercise, but avoided serious trauma.
| 11–15       | The participant was able to work through one or more issues. If this is a character, they have advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity.
| 16–20       | The participant sees themself and their connection to the other participant in a whole new way. If this is a character, they have advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity, and they gain a team building memory (see below).
| 21+         | The participant has had an awakening, gaining a deep sense of who they can become and their connection to their partner. The character has advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity, and gains two team building memories.
|========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

*Team Building Memories.* The most potent personal changes inspired by team building can last a lifetime. Or at least an encounter. A character who earns a team building memory gains an extraordinary ability that can be used once. As a bonus action, the character gains one effect of the enhance ability spell for 10 minutes (no concentration required).
A character can retain team building memories only from the most recent instance of this activity. If a character has unused team building memories and undertakes this activity again, those memories are lost.

*Complications.* At the DM's determination, every team building exercise has a chance of creating a complication as things get real, yo. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Team Building Complications table.

|======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
| d6 | Complication
| 1  | The team building activity is revealed to actually be a death trap, an island of doom, or a similar challenge. The DM determines whether this was an honest mix-up, the act of a disgruntled staff member, or the actions of a rival.*
| 2  | Upon hearing what took place during the team building exercise, uninvolved staff members decide that the franchise is subjecting them to too much trauma. Some staff members might threaten to quit, or decide they want more benefits.
| 3  | It's revealed that the team building exercise was set up by a rival as an opportunity to ambush the participants, or to attack the franchise headquarters while the characters were away.*
| 4  | The participants learn way too much about each other. Each character participating in the activity must select a bond, ideal, or similar background aspect from their partner and come up with a story explaining how this becomes a conflict for them.
| 5  | Staff members who did not participate in the team building exercise feel left out, and morale drops at the franchise. The characters must find a way to raise staff spirits that does not involve running this activity again.
| 6  | A staff member involved in the activity is secretly a member of a rival organization, or has been duped into doing that organization's bidding. During the team building exercise, the rival organization plans to steal franchise secrets or destroy the participants' morale.*
